Venom,Large amounts of fun,MacJunegrand,24-Oct-18,Format: Prime Video,5,"Movie critics have a though job, I get it. They have to watch lots of movies and not for pleasure, but as a job. They can't just relax and have fun, they need to sit down and analyze every bit of a movie: script, acting, effects, lighting, music, dialogue, etc. They also have to compare with films of different genres and with the actors and directors previous efforts. There's a lot of work and baggage, and it's understandable when they demand more from a film. On the other hand, this process means they simply don't see films the way the general public does, and this disconnect sometimes means they'll be harsher on a film than they need to be. Sometimes this will be out of handling different expectations, and sometimes, being human as they still are, it'll be out of pure unfairness.In the case of Venom, it seems to be a combination of both. The film seems to be almost universally reviled by critics while almost universally loved by audiences. While being completely fair I'll admit many of the complaints about this movie are completely legitimate, I still believe the treatment is receiving by critics is still preposterously exaggerated. I've ranted about this before, but it seems critics have simply grown accustomed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's formula, and anything that strays from it in any direction is automatically judged harsher, whether it deserves it or not. And Venom absolutely doesn't. Yes, it's campy. Yes, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Yes, it doesn't have any messages and it doesn't deal with any current socio-political issues. What does Venom offer in place of all that? Simple, primal and unbridled FUN.Venom is the story of Eddie Brock, a reporter who believes in doing the right thing, even by using unconventional methods, and even if it means telling the truth about powerful people. Is because of this that he decides to investigate on a rich industrialist who's secretly kidnapping people and experimenting on them. This gets him in serious trouble, and having no good deed going unpunished, he loses his job, girlfriend and apartment. But when a scientist grows a conscience and tells Brock about the secret experiments the industrialist is doing by merging humans with parasitical sentient goo life form known as ""symbiotes"", he decides to pay a visit and inadvertently becomes host for one of these creatures. Hilarity ensues.The symbiote merging with Eddie calls himself ""Venom"". It's an intelligent creature that needs to feed and has less scruples about killing than Eddie does. With Eddie they form a symbiosis: the alien will augment Eddie's strength, agility and resilience while Eddie provides the alien with sustenance until he can find his companions. Having no choice, since he's being followed by people who want him dead, Eddie complies, but now finds himself bond to a creature that could cause the deaths of millions. Meanwhile, another symbiote named ""Riot"" is traveling the planet in search for the rest, and he has even less respect for other forms of life. Will Eddie be able to control Venom or convince him to join his side or will Venom and Riot unite against humanity?Here's why Venom resonates so much with audiences: the story is simple to follow, the main characters are likable and, unlike other films in recent years, it doesn't try to beat messages into the audience's heads. Expect no attempts at political agendas or social issues; every bit of dialogue is in service of the story or the characters. But the main reason is that both main characters are just really fun to watch. Eddie and Venom form basically a buddy cop movie, with two different personalities clashing and being forced to work together.They're also bloody hilarious. I complain a lot about movies in the MCU using humor as an excuse for plot development, having every character being a snide wise-cracker and ruining legitimately tense moments for the sake of a joke, but this one doesn't fall into those pits. The humor is relegated to Eddie and Venom's relationship, so not all characters feel the same, and tense moments are not punctuated by jokes, so the tension isn't lost.Yes, I'll say that there are a bunch of plot holes and perhaps the story is too overly simplistic for those who expect something more, but if you're willing to just relax and have fun, this movie does the job very well.How does it work as an adaptation? People complained a lot about the movie not being R-Rated and Spider-Man not forming part of the origin story, an I say that those people simply have no idea what they're talking about. Venom has always been goofy in the comics, this isn't a new development, and Spider-Man's involvement is unnecessary, since the character is strong enough to thrive on its own. Yes, having Venom show up in a Spider-Man movie would be benefitial... for Spider-Man's character. But Venom can perfectly work on its own without Spidey. That being said, I would very much like to see the characters clash in the future. We'll have to see, since it's still not clear if Venom and Spider-Man even exist in the same universe yet.Bottom-line: if you're expecting elaborate plots, social messages and/or a serious tone this is the wrong place. But if all you want is fun, Venom will do the job perfectly.",392
Venom,Nobody channels Eddie Brock / Venom like Tom Hardy. Nobody!,kiwijinxter,12-Oct-18,Format: Blu-ray,5,"As someone who had hundreds of Spider-Man comics when I was younger (I even owned a copy of Amazing Spider-Man #300 featuring the first full appearance of Venom), this is the PERFECT Venom origin story. And when I see Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, Venom's alter ego, it makes me feel happy, contented and as fuzzy as the symbiote.In the comics, Eddie Brock is a character that is a bit of an outcast, is unsure of himself and gets even more confused (initially) when Venom entered his life, and Tom Hardy channels Eddie Brock to perfection!!! Venom in the comics had some dark-ish humour, and the humour that Venom spouts in the movie is spot on - in fact Venom gets the best one liners. And the biggest laughs from the audience. The movie portrays a beautiful symbiotic relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom, and shows progression in their relationship throughout the movie.The CGI for Venom is also spot on, making him a highly flexible and versatile character with the symbiotic extensions doing some cool stunts. It makes Venom look cool and dangerous at the same time. The pacing is just right, and Tom Hardy's versatility as an actor really stole the show, so much so that this would work even if this was a one man show.And the post-credit sneak preview is ""one to die for"" - I DEFINITELY want to see the next Venom - it'll be CGI carnage...Peeps, forget the previous incarnation of Venom, this is the REAL deal. Possibly the best movie I've seen in 2018 to date. Stuff the stuffy professional critics. They haven't had any clue for the past 25 years and are no longer credible sources for good movies - much like the fake news. Go watch Venom. It's da bomb!",80
Venom,What a stinker - easily the wost movie I have ever rented on Amazon and I deeply regret it.,Charles Schoch,20-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,"This movie was bad. How bad?  It is the only rental I have memory of where I deeply regret spending the 6 bucks and wish I could take it back.Let's get going with the review.  Let's pretend you went to see a new release of ""Hamlet""  starring a current big name star ...  in fact. Let's go back in time.  Remember when Mel Gibson put out hat new  Hamlet back ... 20 years ago?  Let's pretend that happened.  Only when you went to see Hamlet, Hamlet is not the Prince of Denmark, he's actually Chinese and the movie takes place in 1971 and he is an Astronaut.  You would go ""What the hel is going on here?""  right?  That is the Venom movie.  I'm a *huge* fan of Tom Hardy, but the character isn't Eddie Brock and this isn't Venom.Venom is a bad guy.  Not a ""anti-hero""  not a  ambiguous character that sometimes helps and sometimes does not.  He is a very very bad person.  Eddie Brock is a bad person, the symbiote is a bad space critter - that is one of the reasons they team up against Spider-Man.There is an established  fiction associate with the character.  They didn't make him up, he's been around for 20 years  in stories, which is what  spurred my ""Hamlet"" comparison.  All they seem to have done is buy the like-ness of the character and then kind of went ""Meh"" and just invented a complete new everything for it.The ""complete new everything"" isn't even that great.  Eddie isn't a villain, he's a hero! A reporter every-man who gets smacked down by the corporate ""man"" and his career ruined for seeking the ""truth!""  It's so freaking tired and cliche.  Again - this ain't Hamlet but ... come on.... at least put some effort in.  This smacks of ""we had to make a movie or lose the rights"" to me. A low effort  legal compliance shlock film.The space symbiote is just some self-described ""loser"" from space that likes earth because he isn't such a loser by comparison.  He's like a ...loser superman without the moral framework.  So that sucks and is just bad. It's all so bad.The special effects!  These are pretty bad too, the part's where Mr. Hardy has the symbiote kind of .... composited onto bits of him, like half his face or an arm aren't awful.... there's some serious color issues, but they look ok, the entire effect falls apart when he is full on Venom, which looks terrible.  Whoever did that CG should just hang their head in shame - he looks ridiculous. A man in a rubber suit would look better.The Villian is ... the Indian love-child of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.  ....I'm completely serious.  It is as absolutely stupid as it sounds.There is a love interest for reasons.... she is basically Pepper Potts from IronMan 3.  Yeah, the bad Iron Man where Pepper gets in a suit. coughHINTcough.Basically this movie is a rodeo of failure that smacks of the studio tossing it out the door with the minimum effort given.  Mr. Hardy does his best, but frankly he hasn't got much to work with.  There was once or twice when the dialog between Brock and the Symbiote made me smirk a little,  but largely it falls flat.Final Thought - Don't go see it. It sounds like it's so bad it is good from this - it isn't.  The movie largely takes itself very seriously (with a very small handful of exceptions)  it is a waste of time, save your money.",38
Venom,Excellent!,H. Tague,11-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"Been a huge fan of Venom since the 90s and been waiting for a good live action adaptation of him ever since and it's about time! This film doesn't hold back, it hits fast and hard with top notch action and effects, capturing all the visceral and chaotic energy of the comic book character. Venom is a standout among antiheroes, part lovecraftian nightmare abomination and part twisted mad genius of Todd McFarlane and all awesome!Don't let the critics fool you. They don't like comic characters to start with and their minds are blown and burnt on the runaway success of MCU. This is some of Marvel's best material free of social commentary reveling in it's own excellence!",29
Venom,Not Good,Reginald Thornburton,21-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,"As a fan of Marvel and Tom Hardy, I wanted to like this.  It was just so formulaic and juvenile.  Basically the antithesis of Infinity Wars, which was stellar.  I wasn't expecting this to be the Schindler's List of comic book films but come on, it feels like a group of 10 year olds collaborated to write this piece of crap.  I'm guessing the money it made at the box office is indicative of how much people like the character of Venom and were willing to roll the dice on a poorly reviewed film (as was I) because I highly doubt it was from repeat viewings.  This movie is so bad it's ""recent DC films"" bad.",23
Venom,Missing the mark here,JC,19-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,Wow was i diissapointed it expected it be way better than it was. First hour was boring so you see action at ending and still it’s wasn’t all that exciting.  Thought the reviews would have been more negative.  Just wanted to see more of Venom.  Nothing about the visual effects was impressive to me atol. Overall a movie that could have been great but was simply a big letdown.,16
Venom,overall bad movie/Marvel and Disney failed,Clayton,18-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,This is the first movie in which Tom Hardy acted that I did not like.  This movie was terrible.  The plot was weak.  Venom suddenly wants to save Earth because he likes it and because he likes his host.  The acting was bad on all parts.  They tried to make this movie humorous and failed.  This was just a failure of a movie.  Don't pay to watch this movie.,16
Venom,Wait until 4.99 and rent,Chris Avolt,11-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,Watch the trailer and that is the movie.,17
Venom,I Can't Wait For More Sequels,Rich Whitcomb,22-Dec-18,Verified Purchase,5,"Venom is an awesome movie that everyone should add to their Marvel collection.  Tom Hardy makes a much better Eddie Brock than Topher Grace. The one thing that did bother me about Tom Hardy, is that, he reminded me of Nick (Jake Johnson) from that show New Girl.  He seemed to have almost the exact same quarks, antics, and almost talk the same way too.  The picture, sound, special effects, and CGI are absolutely amazing in this movie!  I also think 4k is spoiling me.  Whenever I used to watch movies on DVD and Blu-ray, the dark scenes were always horrible to watch because you could barely see what was going on, but with 4k, the dark scenes are almost perfect when you watch them and you don't have to strain your eyes to figure out what's going on.  I highly recommend this movie to everybody!  I looked at Tom Hardy's profile to see when the next one would be coming out and there isn't any listed yet, but I read he signed on to do several sequels.  I hope everybody enjoys this movie as much as I did.",11
Venom,Don't get carried away with accuracy,Alex,15-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"I don't have an in depth grasp of the marvel character, so I can't comment on the accuracy of the translation. As a stand alone movie, I think it's fabulous. I like anti-heroes, Spawn has the on the edge stuff too, but Venom does it best. I like that they have the confidence to set up a franchise in the first movie. Usually pioneering movies end in a completed way. If the movie is a success they open a franchise. Here, we get Eddie and Venom in a relatively cooperative state going to meet Carnage.There will always be backlash from fundamentalist fans, but it shouldn't stand in the way of possibility.",10
Venom,"Paid reviews aside, a critical look at ""Venom.""",Vargr,13-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,3,"So, ""Venom,"" where do I start? The good? The bad? The ugly (CGI)?How about instead of a structured thesis-style presentation I just stream of conscious my impressions of the movie?The VERY beginning of Venom is actually pretty bland, it's not unlike the beginning of Rampage, ""space, specimens, oh jeez a wreck."" After this segment, Venom actually does a pretty good job at being a low-impact horror-esque film for a little bit. We see a symbiont jumping from one person to the next, levying horror and murder everywhere it goes. I was pretty engaged, thinking to myself ""this is pretty edgy for a marvel film."" Now, the horror elements are neutered, to the point it kind of reminds me of the ""sweat instead of blood"" SNES Mortal Kombat port of old. You will see some people die, a few get eaten, but you won't ""see"" it if you know what I mean?We're then turned to Eddie Brock and given a glimpse into what a narcissistic loser he is for about 20 minutes. You're also treated to the sociopathic ""genius"" head of the facility that owns the spacecraft you saw in the beginning. Somewhere in this mixture you finally get to see the symbiont that will become Venom jump to Brock. I'm going to take a second here to voice my irritation with how simple they make the bonding process look. In the comics, as Venom evolved, the process of the organism bonding with hosts became much more violent. This aspect of the character should have been maintained in this movie, in my opinion. It would feel much more visceral if you saw images of these ""symbiotes"" somewhat violently forcing themselves on their hosts than the ""oh I've spilled some grape juice on my shirt aaaaaaand it's gone"" kind of effect they went with.For the sake of this review I'll separate Venom into three acts, Eddie merging with the symbiont marks the end of act one. At this point in the movie, there is an abrupt change in tone. It goes from this tame horror style that it established, to a comedy. It's not a smooth transition either, Eddie is walking down the street after escaping the lab, a gravelly voice starts talking to him. There is little time spent studying the bonding process between symbiont and man, there is little time spent showing the symbiont digging into who Eddie is as a person, and there is little time spent explaining or even really discussing the physiological symptoms they describe as byproducts of the union between man and alien. They actually never address this to a point I am comfortable with. In the scene where a doctor describes to Eddie that the symbiont is harming him, potentially even dooming him, they never make a point of explaining how the symbiont is in fact a ""symbiote"" and not a ""parasite"" by definition. At the end of act 2, the movie again abruptly changes pace by ending this comedic stretch it establishes and turning somewhat dark again, as Venom explains that under no uncertain circumstances, it's goal is domination and eradication of the human species, and then earth. Venom even taunts Brock at one point, ""You’re a loser.""The movie lost my attention somewhat around this point, so I may have missed something in the third act, which is where the stereotypical ""redemption and boss battle"" sequence plays in. This is where I really developed some gripes with the CGI, it's pretty lackluster in the beginning, the big ""Venom reveal"" was undercut by just how bad Venom looks, in my opinion at least, maybe you'll be easier on the visuals. Actually, ""bad"" may be a poor choice of word, ""cheap"" is a more accurate term in my mind. He looks ""shiny"" and unrefined, it reminds of 10 year old almost top of the line CGI. The visuals are really unimpressive.From here, we follow Eddie and Venom as become fast friends and eventually fight the other symbiont that's been roaming freely since the beginning of the movie. The final showdown feels like it was meant to be really epic, yet it didn't even keep my eyes on the screen. I actually started playing FFT WOTL on my phone when Eddie made a statement something to the effect of ""I had an alien in my @$$."" The movie eventually ends with a pretty stereotypical death for the main antagonist, and you're then thrust onto Eddie's shoulder as he walks into a prison to interview a serial killer. I did smile when I saw Woody Harrelson's face, that smile turned a furrowed frown with the closing line of the film... ""When I get out of here, and I will... There WILL be... CARNAGE.""I heard Stan and Kyle from Southpark in the back of my head... ""Oh f*** you.""In the end, I'm left with this as an impression... Venom could have been a really good movie. I do understand they /have/ to tie him into the larger Marvel Comics Cinematic Universe at some point, so I get that they needed to present a product tame enough for a wide audience, from their perspectives at least. However, in my opinion, which is worth what it cost you... They could have simply done Venom right as a stand-alone movie, included all the necessary horror and violence elements in full swing, while providing a final act that ran a compelling change of heart on Venom's side, and really still been perfectly set to have him appear in more kid friendly films without much adjustment.So while Venom isn't really a ""bad movie,"" it's a really average film with a great leading man, if it wasn't for Tom Hardy's general affability, the film would have had zero charisma (which was a better movie). I just didn't really find the movie ""likeable,"" I'll watch it again over the weekend with my wife and a few beers, maybe that will improve the experience, but I doubt it.",7
Venom,The Death of Superhero Films,T. Norton,15-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,The film doesn’t know what it really wants to be and the CGI is terribly dodgy. Felt like I was watching a SyFy movie.,11
Venom,Too bad this had to be Stan Lee’s Last Movie,Christopher Hausmann,22-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,"Lame!  My teenagers liked it but that was about it.  The main star subtraction is for Amazon not the movie!!!I just wish that Amazine would let me custom arrange my Video Library instead of only offering by date purchased or alphabetical order.  I would prefer to arrange by genre, episode, number in franchise so that I could group my movies together instead of having a hodge podge to sort through!",9
Venom,"Critics say meh, but they'd be wrong",Sam Kreutzer,15-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"Rotten Tomatoes gives Venom a 28%, IMDb a 6.9/10 and Metacritic a 35% but I strongly disagree. Tom Hardy is excellent as Eddie Brock and Venom. I'd been wanting to see this movie for a while and lemme tell you, 10/10 would recommend. Venom is hilarious and it makes me think about these 'symbiotes' and their consciousness, where they're not so far off from humans. If you're on the edge about this movie, I think it's great! Dark humor, a plot that's pretty easy to follow and who can go wrong with Tom Hardy?",10
Venom,"Rushed, Uninspired, Embarrassing, Poorly cast, at least its short.",Max Lennon Keith,21-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,"This movie is the worst kind of bad movie. A mediocre bad movie. Nothing outstanding here. Undeveloped characters with little to no motivation at all, poor set up, no reason to care. Some fun little action moments here and there and comedy that often falls flat. Cheap looking cgi, Venom looks silly. No reason to watch this movie unless you're a Venom fan I guess.",10
Venom,"The professional critics are but holes. Venom to me surprisingly, OUTSTANDING!!!!!",Mark Schuster,24-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"I DIDN'T DISLIKE ANYTHING!  The initial trailer did the opposite most trailers do. It left me totally uninterested. I normally buy Marvel comic movies. I never read a Venom comic. I will now. The relationship with eddie (incredible actor) and Venom is OUTSTANDING! Ive watched it 5 times for each start i've given it. I rented it thinking it would be so so from the trailer. trust me its not so so. It is the most FUN movie i've seen in a long time. I loved avengers infinity war. I loved Ragnarok. But I loved Venom the most. There is no part I fast forwarded through even on the 5th watch !BUY IT! totally outstanding.This is the first Tom Hardy movie i've ever seen. What a power house. incredible dry humor.  His conversations with Venom are hysterical! I mean if I were falling off a building screaming I could never think of ""Where did you go...where did you go ahhhhh stop. I got us lol each scene is just incredibleBy the elevators Venom says  JUMP as they are like 200 stories in the air. Next scene Tom hardy (eddie) is pushing the elevator button.Venom says in his venom voice ""Pussy"" you gotta be there ! incredible ! Im not much for the academy awards but id give both Edie and venom an academy award!  ""Another great line ""No you do not eat policemen"" lol Its not frightening, but then none of the Marvel movies are frightening.  Its just super entertaining. And Im not one to ever much do a review unless I absolutely love it.I wonder who played Venom. his voice and the things he said the way he said them incredible!",5

Venom,Loads Of Entertainment,VictoriaSelene Skye~Deme,12-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"I kept checking daily for Venom to become available to buy since all I heard was good things from my friends, and they were right. Mind blown. Love the story, the concept, the detailed flow of the outline, the interesting context and the incredible special effects are TOP NOTCH!  The humor is delightful, darkly delightful, I don't know who does the voice of Venom, but the delivery is perfection. This is a watch over and over again movie. So glad it finally became available, this was one I was salivating for! And I was not disappointed. 10 stars!!!!",6
Venom,Loved it!,SHAWN KERMANI,11-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"I am sorry but the critics don't know what they are talking about. This is a great Venom based movie. Tom Hardy does a excellent job playing both Eddie Broc, and Venom. The critics all cried foul over one issue most of all, and that was , ""Where is Spiderman?"", WHO CARES if Spiderman is not in the movie, I came to see Venom. ""But you can't have Venom without Spiderman."" Yum, yes you can!Anyway, long story short Venom is both dark, funny, and sappy at times. Could it have been more violent if it had an R rating? Sure, but nonetheless it is worth your money and time if you are a fan of Venom.",6
Venom,Just not good,E. Ostrom,16-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,Maybe if your a Tom Hardy fan you can look past this mess of a movie.  It takes forever before before Venom shows up. The story is long and boring.,8
Venom,VERY Misleading Runtime,MovieMan M,8-Jan-19,Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase,3,"The movie itself is alright, it's just that it's actually only 90 minutes long with 17 minutes of end credits, a two minute mid-credit scene, and a four minute post credit clip from the upcoming spider-verse movie. This is even more frustrating because the first actual Venom transformation isn't until the 1 hour mark, so the movie is basically an hour of build-up and then 30 minutes of action.",6
Venom,Better than Spider-Man 3,James Wink,26-Dec-18,Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase,3,"Watching Venom, I was pleasantly surprised -  I was better than it had any right to be after a series of disappointing trailers and bad critical reviews. There are many reasons why this movie is not very good - the plot is laughable, the CG goes from pretty decent to horrible. For Marvel-fans, it pretty much destroys any continuity from the comic books. With these negatives, the review should be 1 - 2 stars but I am giving Venom three stars for one reason: Tom Hardy. His presence anchors Venom in a way that makes all the criticism fall away. His performance is the best thing about the movie and elevates it into a respectable movie. He makes you sympathetic to Eddie Brock, an anti-hero with very few redeemable qualities. What helps elevate his performance is that Eddie doesn't really become a hero....he is still on the line between hero and villain at the end of the movie (I will leave it up to fellow viewers to determine which side of the line).Venom is still not a good movie but it is far from the debacle that everyone suspected before its release. I am cautiously optimistic about the inevitable sequel.Mild Recommend.",3
Venom,Ignore the critic and watch this movie!,Linda J.,16-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,I heard so many bad things about this movie that I waited for video to watch it.  I'm sad that I did.  It was AWESOME!!!  Tom Hardy did an excellent job with both characters.  It was entertaining and funny.  I'm glad I bought it so I can watch it again and again.,6
Venom,Partner up with your own Symbiont.,fenx1200,21-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"I thought the beginning of the movie was a bit cheesy as well as the acting.  Perhaps a low budget movie was going to unfold before my eyes with really one good actor, and that is Tom Hardy, and even his acting was a bit troubling.  However, as the plot unfolded, the action and the acting picked up quickly leading to a movie in which I had to stay tuned to every minute, lest I would miss something vital to the overall performance.  The movie quickly grew on me and I found myself embracing the alien, Venom. and his partner, Tom Hardy, as both of them teamed up to destroy evil for the greater good of the earth. I won't spoil the plot, and keep in mind that this is a Marvel Universe film, not an epic masterpiece like Gone With The Wind, but perhaps just as important when it comes to saving the Earth from an Alien Invasion.  If you love Marvel movies, then you will enjoy this one, and perhaps you'll want to get your own symbiont, and fight crime to feed the beast.",3
Venom,A Very Hardy Movie,K. Borah,18-Jan-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,4,"The story suffers from what I now call Stan Lee Syndrome or Origins disease. Seems Marvel can't write a script without bogging it down with origins and this plight as infected several other media presentations of late... Think about the excessive flash backing in almost every TV show or spending needless story time making sure we know way more then we need to know about why someone is the way they are. Be that has it may, this film survives, not by it's creative storytelling by any stretch of the imagination or lack there of but by it's strong casting. Mainly Tom Hardy, the titular character who is able to bring a refreshing grounded quality in portraying his plight to understand and comprehend the strange things that are happening to him. Michelle Williams is a bright star who deserves more screen time then she is given here. By the time the credits role you are left wondering why they did not let us know more about her then we were allowed to enjoy. Overall, seeing this film on its first viewing prompted me to see it again (something few films have accomplished since LOTR) says a great deal about it's watch-ability. Die hard fans seem to complain that the Venom character is toned down too much from its comic book persona and I can understand why this would be an issue. It seems this would have been better served has a Hard R action fest then a over produced Saturday matinee extravaganza that it has become, but it still manages to entertain just for performances if not the story or the lack thereof.",2
Venom,"A fun movie, of a comic character world. I hope they do more with Tom Hardy!",jason guion,23-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,4,"Before watching it I saw a review on YouTube savaging this movie. The guy made a high production value and very long video decrying so called dual prologues, confusing time jumps...but I rented anyway. I really enjoyed it, and I feel sorry for anyone who was unable to go into a movie understanding it comes from a comic book, and wasn’t supposed to touch nerves the way Saving Private Ryan does. Tom Hardy is a great actor of our time in my opinion. Roles like his homeless Stuart, as scary London gangsters, all the way to roles as a good guy with a sweet disposition are all great to watch, and he does a great job here of being kind but tough good man with a broken heart trying to do good, while doing an excellent job having to pretend that there is a whole other living personality inside him deciding to move in permanently, knowing everything it’s host knows and feels. The review said the effects were average, but they were as good as any, and the story is fast, and funny with great thought out action sequences. Who doesn’t love Steve Mcqueen inventing the car chase, and then doesn’t enjoy a kick butt chase here as well. Everyone did a great job acting, and the there are only really one time jump, and it is simply forward. If that is confusing, or you came for some never before seen special effects as your motivation instead of the Venom comic world and story in it then go see something else. This was fun and I hope Tom Hardy and the others do some more movies very soon. And that Hardy pops that guy in the nose once, for actually putting the dictionary definition of prologue on the screen in his review as though it is some special knowledge no one else understands! Fun movie!",2

Venom,It's not perfect but it doesn't have to be because IT'S A VENOM MOVIE!!!,Landon,28-Dec-18,Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase,4,"First, I will start by saying this movie was not perfect, but it is leading to something soon to be great.(SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT)..The villain was okay, but I thought it would feature multiple symbiotes fighting Venom as more were discovered at the crash sight. But nope, it was just riot vs venom. The others were no where to be found towards the end of the movie. It does however make you think though as to what happens to the others, maybe one of them is carnage looking for a new host (Cletus)??? Who knows??? All I know is that this movie is still a fun ride. The action was awesome and Venom looked very cool. The cg of venom was kind of bad at times, and yet other times it looked good which was weird. It felt like some scenes the cgi was done differently by different people, which explains why at times Venom looks great and then a little fake the next shot. Overall, the movie was a fun ride and I'm sure the budget for the next film will allow for a better cg venom. All I know is I'm ready for some Carnage. Can't wait for Venom 2!!!! I highly suggest this movie.",2
Venom,"Uneven and full of plotholes, but fun",mcteenie,19-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,3,"The odd part of this movie is that I feel like despite the first third of it grinding on forever setting up Eddie Brock and his foes that the plot and characters are 2 dimensional and cliche.  Near the end, everyone's motivations seemingly come out of nowhere (and don't benefit from all the meandering plot building in the establishing act) and there's zero reason you'd imagine anyone to be doing whatever they're doing.  If cut and paced better, maybe this wouldn't annoy me so much and the film would warrant more than one viewing.  Others have pointed out that it does feel like a throwback to 90s superhero/action films (for better or worse) and I'll definitely agree with that.I think all the actors (who are otherwise phenomenal) are wasted in this.  Tom Hardy meanders through like an unlikeable drunk which may have been the point.  The cast is great, but they presumably did their best with the script they were given.Overall, I had fun watching this.  Venom (the character) was great and when things finally started happening it was a fun ride.  Venom interacting with Eddie came off as hokey at first, but was pretty funny once I stopped framing the movie in my head as a ""serious"" super hero movie.I'm confused as to why Sony made this film; now that Spider Man is in the other Marvel universe and was very conspicuously absent , it leaves out a big part of Venom's story and origin.  Even in the unlikely event that Venom made the jump to that universe, he's coming over more or less fully formed and it would be weird to retcon his origin and hatred of Spider Man to use his character the way comic fans would expect.Superhero films have come a long way, but I think a lot of us have lost track of the fact that super powered people in costumes and alien symbiotes are pretty ridiculous when you think about it.  Maybe Venom could have been a better developed film, but it's an alien parasite that eats people and riffs with Tom Hardy's character.  If you aren't expecting The Dark Night or something that is faithful to the comics Venom can be fun.",3
Venom,LOVED THIS MOVIE!,Cassandra Rodriguez,22-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,Finally something NEW and something DIFFERENT. This movie was hands down amazing.

Venom,Tom Hardy has my vote in being Venom,MarioLegend,26-Jan-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"This story version of Venom is totally acceptable to me. The movie narrative overall is fun to watch and Tom Hardy got my vote in being Venom. I'm intrigued in what the producers will do with this going forward. Also to add, I went in with low expectations and I was very well surprised in seeing this new take on the infamous comic book character. I can't wait to see more.Side note: Just gotta have an open mind and accept different takes on things creatively. This take on the character is good one and has my attention on what comes after. There are so many versions of Venom out there too- and this one is just another one that currently shines for me. Hell, maybe we can see a Venom-verse? Once people who are so stuck up understand there is a multiverse full of different versions of the character, they can just drop it and let others enjoy another perspective. Granted, it has the blessing of Stan Lee and Marvel Studios, so I'm totally fine with this. Sony is getting better with being more open to getting help in making a good story.(pardon my bad grammar)",2
Venom,DO NOT READ THE CRITICS REVIEWS! Venom and tom hardy kill it.,Tabby22,1-Jan-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,Being a life long spider-man and Venom fan this movie hits the mark for a post evil Eddie Brock Movie.  Venom holds its own without Spidy same as the Agent Venom comics.  Ignore the critics who look at this as a sub par movie and look at it as an action packed grey area super hero movie.  If you ever wanted to know what  the banter between Eddie and venom would be this is the movie for it.  As well no white spider and the fixing of the pronunciation of the word symbiote sold it.  Cant wait for the next movie SPOILER: Woody Harilson as Cletis Cassidy will just rock.,3
Venom,A Step Up For Marvel,Review,29-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,4,"Venom is a commendable divergence by Marvel away from mythology and the uni-dimensional superhero characters of the recent past into a more complex territory of science fiction. Some might call Venom a kind of an optimistic update to the 1978 classic Scifi film ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"", but with many twists.  Tom Hardy brings a comic and subtly self-deprecating dimension into the fold that works very well in his portrayal of Eddie Brock, a journalist with a conscience and Michelle Williams is wonderful as Anne Weying, Eddie's ex-fiancee and a San Francisco district attorney. It is somehow too easy to give too much of this film away by discussing it. Suffice it to say that it is entertaining and worth a look, especially if you have been burned out by too many run of the mill superhero films.",2

If your a comic fan you'll find that not everything is perfect, but what you get us good acting, great special effects, nice humor all tied up with a nice bow and a clue to who's in venom 2.With a different origin than the books venom starts off in this film trying to stop his host brothers from taking over the world and trying to stop the nefarious life foundation from aiding them in this plot.Do not miss this latest marvel movie!  Yes it does not mention spider man and yes it is missing his character giving venom a thumbs up to carry the mantle but what it does have is a good supporting cast and a fresh start to the marvel/venom universe.",2

This movie was both badass and trippy, had a very well balanced storyline tied to its insane action. There was a part that looked like a work of art, if that's what you guys were aiming for with that scene, you nailed it. Top of that, I was so lost in it, I wasn't even bothered by the fact that there was no Spider-man (like the comic). Hands down, Tom Hardy is Venom.",3
Venom,Marvel's The Odd Couple,Fryzilla,30-Jan-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,3,"Well...this was something. Just to let you know, I love Venom, he's one of the most bad@$$ comic book characters ever, and I was thrilled when I heard there was going to be a movie about him. I saw the trailers for it, and it looked awesome. Then I rented the movie...umm, ok. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the movie, I just don't think it was all that good. While I do think that Tom Hardy was good as Eddie Brock and the design of the symbiotes are pretty cool, especially that slow-mo freeze framing of Venom and Riot fighting with Eddie and Drake fighting along with them (someone should win an award for that scene), I do think that the movie as a whole is a little erratic. Venom himself doesn't appear on screen until the end of the first hour of the movie, although it was pretty glorious when he did. The action and effects were pretty good, although there were times that I couldn't tell what was happening because everything was going too fast. I am a bit disappointed that Spider-Man was not in, or even mentioned in this movie; since, you know, he is a BIG PART OF VENOM'S CREATION! Seriously, how is this a Venom origin story without Spider-Man? I do like the chemistry between Eddie and Venom. What? It's better than that unnecessary romantic subplot with Eddie and his ex-girlfriend. They're like Jekyll and Hyde, if Jekyll was trying to keep Hyde from eating people and end up as total bros. Overall this was a mixed bag for me. It's both good and bad, but it's still an entertaining movie! I just wish it was R-rated like it should have been.",1
Venom,NO SPOILERS Review - It was non-sense,Dustin,18-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,2,"NO SPOILERS - Complete and total detachment of anything Marvel or original story line.There are so many things about the movie that don't make sense it would actually take some time to put all of it together.  Here are some of the worst parts...1. Venom and the other symbiots seem to have a human like form when they come out even though they have supposedly never been in contact with humans.2. They move magically through clothes to take form instead of through the skin like they should.3. There is almost no explanation for why venom helps Eddie except that on Venom's planet he is apparently a ""loser"" as well, subjected to some form of socialization on his planet which seems ridiculous because they need a host to live on earth but on its own planet it's basically a moving blob.4. The symbiotic creatures already have a mind of their own and seem to understand everything going on around them even prior to any human interaction.5. They also claim to know everything about the host, but yet still don't know many things that would seem obvious if it could read the hosts mind.6. The plot never makes you care about Eddie or any of the symbiotic creatures at all.  The entire cast could have died and nobody would have shed a tear.  No character development outside of some fluffy, surface layer type things.Why re-write Venom?  The original story was a MUCH better story than this weird alien sub-culture movie that you see here.  Only reason it got 2 stars was because I made it through the movie without turning it off, but it was rough.",1

Venom,Wasted Potential,Justin Welch,6-Jan-19,Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase,2,"Video and Audio Quality are great, the film not so much.Even taking it for what it is, without Spidey in the equation, it's just a mess that reeks of studio meddling. The cgi varies from great in places, to 90s TV show awful in others. The Script is a mess, with sub plots being brought up extremely briefly and never mentioned again, the villains motivations are nonsensical and laughable, and most of the actor's performances come off as OOT or phoned in.The exception being Tom Hardy, who himself does well with what he was given, but the Eddie Brock you know from the comics, this character is not.It's a shame really, because there are moments here that really shine and show potential, most of which you can tell came from the film's intended ""horror"" direction that was clearly scrapped for a by the numbers hero flick.Best thing about about the movie was the credits song by Eminem...and I say that as someone who hates Eminem.Don't buy this film unless you're a die hard Marvel fan who is going to buy them all anyway.",1

Venom,Very fun,Mike S.,21-Jan-19,Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase,5,"This is an MCU adjacent movie. It exists in the world of Spiderman, but the decision was to use it as a stand alone movie without using the black suit version of Spiderman to introduce Venom (as was done in Spderman 3), Therefore, the symbiots were brought to Earth from a space mission, killing all but one of the astronauts. They were discovered by the head of the company that funded the mission called Life Sciences, who then begins experimenting bonding the symbiots with homeless and drug addicted humans. Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock, a former reporter who was fired and now doing freelance work. Of course, one of the symbiots joins with him to form Venom.The movie is a great blend of action and very dark humor. Because they did not use Spiderman, Venom is introduced in the anti-hero version of the character, doing bad things (mainly eating) bad guys. There is a great supporting cast including Jenny Slate, Scott Haze,  Riz Ahmed, and Michelle Williams, who plays the ex-wife of Eddie Brock. She does a really great job playing off Tom Hardy, and brings a lot of the comedy to the movie, which is outside her usual acting roles. The best part of the movie is the discussions/arguments/bickering that goes on between Brock and Venom, mostly in Brock's mind which makes it look to everyone else like he is talking to himself. It also requires Hardy to do a lot of physical comedy, which he turns out to be great at.For those who get the 4K blu-ray, the movie looks and sounds great. On the UHD disc there is only the movie and the into the spiderverse preview. All the other extras are on the regular blu ray. Those include several deleted scenes, including an extended version of the end credits scene which teases where the next movie will go assuming it gets made, then about an hour's worth of making of and behind the scenes material mixed with some featurettes on the history of the Venom character. Definiitely a lot there, and very good.I cannot say everyone will like the movie, and it definitely pushes the PG-13 rating to the limit, mostly because of the language. There is a lot of swearing and some sexually suggestive jokes. It is closer to Deadpool than it is to say Avengers. But it puts a different twist on the MCU movies, and sets up a good possible franchise to exist in that universe. It worth checking out.",NA
Venom,"""We're gonna eat your brain!"" - Venom",Matt Blank,2-Jan-19,Format: DVDVerified Purchase,4,"Really good Marvel action/comic movie.  I own all of the early Venom Lethal Protector comics from '93.  This movie is a accurate yet modern interpretation of the very early events of the Lethal Protector series.  Venom is true to form.  Hardy plays a good Eddie Brock, kind of gritty with a dark sense of humor, again, similar to the comic books.  Storyline left the door open for more Venom movies.  Defenately recommended for all Venom fans and Marvel fans.  Looking forward to Gambit next.  Can't wait!",2

It's nonstop fun the entire time.  It's funny.  It's dark.  Tom Hardy is absolutely perfect as my favorite loser in the galaxy (and apparently Venom's favorite loser as well).  It's the type of movie you can watch a million times and never get sick of it.  My dad even loved it.  Though, he brilliantly pointed out that Venom clearly has a crush on Eddie and absolutely kissed him, which made this even better.  10/10 would recommend.",2

Venom,It's nothing special,LaJay,23-Dec-18,Verified Purchase,2,"There's a lot of debate about the origin story this movie was adapted from. Personally, I remember Venom not from the Lethal Protector storyline, so I can relate to people who thought it out of place to see Venom with no relation to Spiderman. Even ignoring that, it was a pretty poorly constructed film.It should have been R-rated. Yep, it really should have been. Venom comics (and a lot of comics, believe it or not) contain a fair amount of blood and violence. Venom is a dark, horrifying character, and the PG-13 rating -- along with the nature of the story and overall writing -- turned him into something about as scary as Smaug from The Hobbit. Like, maybe scary to a 7 year old.Venom should have been an uncomfortable, visceral experience; taunting us to eventually cheer for a murderous alien psychopath -- along with the slimy, self-serving human being he merges with -- who happens to be slightly less murderous than his alien comrades.Also, the CGI and actually the basic design of Venom was pretty bad. It looked more like half-assed claymation than anything else. Also, it reeks of standalone, setting it apart from one of the factors that have made the MCU and the entirety of the comic book universe so successful: crossovers! It's like the creators of this film learned nothing from the mistakes of the early 2000s comic adaptations.Sure, I guess it's ""fun,"" and some people are apologetically calling it ""average."" I just call it a waste of time.",NA
Venom,Thirty minutes wasted,David L Hertzberg,24-Dec-18,Verified Purchase,1,I barley tolerated the first thirty minutes. Does this movie have any redeeming qualities? I'd rather not know. I wish I hadn't wasted my money.,4
Venom,Ouch.,Micah,27-Oct-18,Format: DVD,2,"It's not as bad as an MCU film, but it looks like Sony intends to head in that direction.This movie feels generic from beginning to end despite that it's centered around some of my favorite comic book characters. It takes SOME ideas from the comics and tries to iterate them somewhat seriously (unlike disneymarvel), but it still likes to throw in some ""haha, it's awkward and/or this really cool character is a failure right now"" jokes, and it makes me sick.As for its regard to the source material, they completely miss the mark with Eddie. They didn't even TRY. This is the first time anyone has tried to make Eddie a complete wuss rather than a sleazy guy with decent goals. He also doesn't have anyone who so personally ruins his life in the film, so the suit has no actual reason to cling to Eddie, let alone call him a good host. There are no rules for what qualifies him as a good host. Symbiotes don't need to feed on anger or hatred, I guess. Not only does this ruin the logic of the movie and spit on the comics (and the intelligence of the audience, while we're at it), but it also completely nullifies the line, ""we are Venom.""Even throughout the film, anyone who says the name ""Venom"" is not referring to Eddie and the symbiote. They're referring specifically to the symbiote. Spider-Man in the suit isn't Venom. Mac Gargon in the suit isn't Venom. Way to absolutely destroy the best part about the character. For that matter, there's even the line ""I am Venom"" in the movie!Riot was poorly executed as well. He's never been a team leader (unless there's a comic about that I'm not aware of; I don't keep up with him in particular). However, Riot does not have a pronounced snout like this film portrays. To make it worse, no Klyntar has ever clung to Carlton despite his complete fascination with them. To make it WORSE, he's played by a middle-eastern youth. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the inclusion of several races and all, but why don't companies make new characters and stories to do it with? That's like making a a new Sonic the Hedgehog game, but Sonic's green and Tails is purple. The goal of cinematic adaptation is to do just that: adapt the characters and concepts to cinema.One thing the film sorta gets right is that the Venom Klyntar was an outcast from his race, but the movie doesn't go anywhere with it, and it manages to screw up details. Instead of explaining that he's actually deemed insane because he wanted to assist hosts rather than consume them, ""I'm kind of a loser."" Really? That's like making Peter Parker wear the mask for kicks instead of protecting people he knows.Lastly, I must say it's an odd choice to have Woody Harrelson play Cletus Kassady. It's not really BAD, but it's about as fitting for the role as Tom Hardy for Eddie Brock.The only REALLY FUN parts of this movie revolve pretty much entirely around Venom himself. It's fun to watch the unique changes in his maneuvers using the wet and sticky physics or pouncing around like an angry, wild, reckless Spider-Man. That's what Venom really should be. Come to think of it, Sony has a bit of a history with getting the action scenes right. They actually make use of a character's traits and allow the character to think based on those traits, and while some other companies do it from time to time, Sony is almost always consistent with it.Eminem tried to destroy the movie, but frankly, I don't think it needed his help.All in all, this movie left me very confused. Riot, Carlton, Anne, and a handful of other concepts in this are all oddly aware of what the comics are like, but the story it tells is detached and not as engaging as it could have been. It feels like a small struggle (but not small enough to be personal, like Venom's grudge with Spider-Man seen anywhere except in Venom's own movie), and you get the happy ending you expected. Worth watching? Ehhhhhh. If you can appreciate some awesome physics being applied to an awesome design in the wrong story, then yeah, it's worth watching. I can't say enough that the visuals and sounds in this movie are SO MUCH FUN, but they deserve more respect and better writing.",21

I would daydream while thumbing through my comic books and would often miss certain dialogues and conversations as I was transported into the comic and part of the action.Venom took me back to my childhood although like most movies try to modernize and alter the story for commercial and audience familiarity. As the Venom story was being introduced I was starting to discover video games and didn't follow the whole symbiote storyline. Fast forward to today and I will admit that while some of the storyline is entertaining and looks great visually it is not the story that I remember (insert wiper snapper comment here).

Venom,"Not good, but it has it's moments",Tyler Baker,7-Feb-19,Verified Purchase,2,"The story here and the writing is horrible.  They spend SO LONG setting up the rules of Venom only to spend the last 40 minutes ignoring them to service the messy plot.  I think the first 20 minutes is a waste of time and only after Tom Hardy gets Venom does he get actual acting work to do (which he is great at as always), but everything aside from the special effects and Hardy were troublesome.  In an age where Avengers Infinity War came out months before this as the high mark of comicbook movies, this was a huge step BACK to the time when Daredevil and Elektra were the big movie flops.  Like they learned nothing from Deadpool or Thor Ragnarok.  Riz Ahmed was decent as the villian, he had this slimmy way about him, but there wasn't enough for him to shine.  All in all, the best scene is the one after the credits and that set up for Venom 2 is the only real reason to watch this.  Still, I bought it because of the 4k value of the cgi.

Although the drama between Mary Jane, Spider-Man, and Venom will be missed, the rest of the story was truly wonderfully done.Also, Tom Hardy.

That scene where he's waiting for the elevator...The bluray has some fantastic behind the scenes extras, in particular the making of featurettes.

Venom,"If You Were Expecting Better, You Weren't Paying Attention",N / A,1-Mar-19,Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase,3,"An origin story for an iconic character such as Venom easily aroused major interest in the comic book adaptation furor of the modern age. However, that furor should've dissolved by the announcement of its creative team rather than a trailer or PG-13 rating. The director & writers of Venom are responsible for Gangster Squad, The 5th Wave, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, The Dark Tower and Fifty Shades of Grey. If you think that combination would produce another The Dark Knight (2008), The Avengers (2012) or Logan (2017), you were self-deluded (or not paying attention).Venom should've been an unmitigated disaster. However, if one is able to discard all expectation or notion of what a Venom adaptation should be, you might be able to get sucked into the entertainingly vacuous spectacle of it all, which was replete with humor and unapologetic bombast that even at its height feels more measured and considered than the third act of any recent D.C. Extended Universe film where everything descends into people throwing large objects at each other.Venom is not a great film, but its also quite harmless. It sought to be entertaining rather than thoughtful, and achieved that very result. It may be a disappointment to fans wanting a faithful adaptation but as I said before, that expectation should've been dropped upon learning who the director and screenwriters were.",NA
Venom,"Not worth 20, maybe 5",M. E. Guerrero,28-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,"Let me break it down, and I will preface this by saying I appreciate the effort...1. Tom Hardy : Had the role down, the character, I could tell, but the performance wasn't there,The character didn't grow and wasn't presented thoroughly and it showed through the directing. At some point he had the character but it felt like he didn't let character free it was in his head. Venom has a legacy. Sad tho, I really wanted to see him rock it, he was cast well tho.2. Riz Ahmed- Good character, but too much talking, not enough expressive through acting. Almost had it  , but many scenes weren't timed correctly and it appeared not in sync ( between the story line and the actual camera time)..But I did like him as the character, but he needed to be darker(depth).3. Michelle Williams - Good character, good lines, but stood out because of gaps with other characters delivery.4.Venom - He is Venom, outer -space, symbiote, but portrayed as computer generated and voice fx , not modern, no character, all fx.5. Setting - SF - You choose a setting, but don't really use it, the setting was used as if it was a fly over town. Really missed an opportunity to use the city to its potential.I am not picking on anyone, I just noticed these things, and want to point them out.

I was so looking forward to this movie, having missed it in theaters. I wish I would have rented it. Tom Hardy, who is awesome in other movies, is either mis-directed or was really distracted and his love interest in wearing a wig that is beyond-distracting. I actually googled ""Venom Wig"", go ahead and see for yourself, I'll wait. It's not just bad, it's reeeeeeeeally awful. What the heck happened. So disappointed. If you need to watch it, I get it - I'm with you! - but please rent it and save yourself a few bucks.",NA

Venom,Tedious,singer,13-Jan-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,20min into the film and I was bored to tears. It’s predictable full of comic film tropes. The characters are hollow even the main played by Williams and Hardy. It’s like a caricature of a comic film. Then there’s the politics. It’s laden with ideological left wing cliches which weighs down the already empty script. It’s two hours of yawn!,1
Venom,Had such potential,jt22,9-Feb-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,3,"Could have been soo good if the studio wouldn’t get in the way . The casting was great , graphics were awsome, characters (for the most part ) were fantastic together, but in the end the story sucked and carnage should have been reviled at the end as the big bad not some written in bad guy who no one cares about. If you cut out all the content of useless plot and love story and just focused on eddie and venom this movie would have been awsome.Let the writers of dead pool take a crack at playing with Tom Hardys Eddie and Venom .Tom Hardy still rocked as both Eddie and Venom dispite the script sucking",NA
Venom,Better than I thought,AR Diamond,18-Feb-19,Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase,5,"Not for the younger children with this much violence unless they watch Alien on a regular basis which I am generally not a fan of, but the amount of comedy in this was enough to get me past the gory scenes. Some how I think I missed this character in the comics growing up or perhaps he came after I stopped reading them, but those that did in the house liked the movie and the comedic side that you might not have expected from that cover. Plus it had Stan Lee's guest appearance which is always fun to watch for in the movie.",NA
Venom,Good flick.  Can’t go wrong when Hardy is involved.,Asage,25-Feb-19,Verified Purchase,5,"Being a Tom Hardy fan, I got what I wanted; good acting, solid performance.  The effects are good, the story moves fast for sake of storyline vs character and backstory building, the voiceover of venom is a perfect fit, the comedy is there but not overshadowing the severity of the story.  Overall, I enjoyed it and thought it was fun and solid.  Could have been longer but I get it, lots of money and deadlines, slow movie-goers on average and must appeal to the masses.....still, I would have preferred another 20-30 minutes.",NA
Venom,Zero expectations...but really like it,FBW,19-Feb-19,Verified Purchase,5,"I'll admit, this was a Sunday night movie choice my buddy made that I was just  ""mehh, okay"" about at first. Just like all of you, I'm a big comic book, sci-fi, fantasy nerd and I have my own issues with the non-canon movie/TV story ""re-telling's"" but, I actually enjoyed Venom from start to finish.

I understand he needs to pay bills but he should've skipped this role.  The writing was terrible and formulaic.  The characters were very flat with no arc or development so we don't care about their motivations.  I started fast-forwarding about 15 minutes into the movie and couldn't finish it.

I mean - not just bad, but unforgivably bad.  Hokey. Stupid. Sloppy. Trite. Hardy completely miscast. I can’t say don’t waste your $ - because many reviewers like it.  Maybe you will too.

Venom,Are you kidding me?,poony2,13-Jan-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,I'm amazed anyone thought this was a good movie. It had lots of potential but ended up just insulting what little intelligence I have. Special effects were cool but the story was lame. I want a story with substance but those are usually true and retold. It seems to me that the creativity of Hollywood is diminishing. Of course I didn't like Castaway either and lots of people liked it. Who talks to a soccer ball for years when marooned on a deserted island? I guess actually talking to God would seem ludicrous to anyone who gave that movie even 3 stars.,1
Venom,Good movie,Kurt,21-Feb-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,4,"This movie was packed full of action. However, it was really mostly just that - action, action, action. There was definitely a story, but it wasn't really the driving force of the movie. Also, there was a lot of unrealistic ""eating people"" that didn't seem plausible at all. Not to mention, how some people reacted to such situations was completely unrealistic. This movie definitely could have been a lot better, but as an action movie it works.",NA
Venom,90% of a great film,Johnny in Texas,12-Jan-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,4,"Tom Hardy delivers in this film...  good plot overall... however...  it completely deviates from the original marvel story line.

Venom,Mediocre at best.  Warning - spoiler alert!,Infinity8,23-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,3,"1. Love Tom Hardy - do not love his American accent and I got the impression he didn't like it either.2. Tom Hardy cannot portray loser, kind of guy, especially while sporting serious guns. Giving him clothes and a scruffy beard, did not help.3. Transition of evil creature from evil creature to sort of good creature did not play well at all. There was no lead in no explanation nothing. Which made the movie from that point on pretty foolish.",NA

Venom,Not Worth Renting <U+0001F44E>,Sean,18-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,2,Ugh <U+0001F612> when did Venom become a good guy? Saves the earth? Big task. Tom Hardy seemed to play a dork. It's slow then lots of fast action that didn't look right. The ending ... just slashes the shuttle and bad guy blows up but was able to survive everything else. Having a big star and an Eminem song doesn't make it a good movie. The whole thing was a mess. They couldn't put it together right. Certain scenes were entertaining hence 2 stars.,NA
Venom,The critics need an enema,Curtis,16-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,4,"This comment is coming from a guy who's a Dredd 2012 fan (which, I think got a poor reception as well), i think Venom might be along the same vein, maybe a bit less charming - as far as cinematography goes. I simply thought the film was entertaining.This isn't meant to be a goody super hero film. It isn't meant to be some cinema masterpiece. It's simply pulp... and that's okay.Hope this gives some perspective.",1

Venom,Venom Gets Neutered,Gene Bates,31-Jan-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,4,"Not as good as you hoped and not as bad as its made out to be. The film has good effects, nice action scenes and a dose of comedic relief. Some of the lines are stupid and worsened upon delivery. The film wraps up rather quickly; which seems to be a result of reaching their budget cap more than anything. I've watched it twice and overall the film feels like an early effort in the superhero genre.",NA
Venom,Just the right ballance between action and comedy,Crunchy moma with 3 boys,8-Jan-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,Ive hered that people disliked what they had venom saying inside of his head. But think about it hes an alien and it would be telepathic but also translated so it makes sense to me that he wouldn't always make 100% human sense. hes going to think completely different then  human.  I loved everything about it. Good writing tied most thing together. a few loose ends but all and all well thought out.,NA
Venom,"Humorous but dark, definitely PG 13",History Buff,4-Jan-19,Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase,5,Great fun. The alien arguing with his human host kept me laughing the entire movie. A little darker than most Marvel movies and has a slightly heated love scene that isn't suitable for  kids under 13. Stan Lee makes his usual cameo. Wonder if they will CGI him in future movies since sadly he has passed. The movie plot drifts from the classic VENOM storyline as he is not the dark alternate Spider-Man suit gone live but the storyline is a nice reboot.,NA
Venom,"Flawed, but entertaining.",Eric L. Gibson,10-Feb-19,Verified Purchase,3,"I loved how Venom was portrayed in this. He was big, scary, and powerful. He even paired well with Tom Hardy, in my opinion.That being said, the construction of the story was totally Amateur Hour. I understand that Marvel movies are formulaic from the get-go, but this story was WAY too cookie-cutter to ignore. They certainly could've done better in building a more interesting plot.Overall, though, the movie was truly fun. Fanboys will wail in agony because it wasn't perfect, but I wasn't expecting The Shawshank Redemption going into it.It was worth the price of admission.",NA
Venom,Tom Hardy does it again!,Hannah,20-Jan-19,Verified Purchase,5,"What can I say? A lot of people don’t like this movie, but it was extremely enjoyable. Tom is funny as Eddie Brock AND as Venom, he has some really great one liners; the dialogue between the two in the car chase scene and the apartment encapsulates Tom Hardy’s talent as an actor. I would group this in with Deadpool, but it’s much cleaner! The style is much of the same, it’s defintely more for adults, as I think a lot of the darkness and humor would be lost on children. Love this film, ignore your friends and give it a shot.",NA

Venom,Tom Hardy is oscar worthy,John Black,5-Jan-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"But because its a film like venom he will not get one. The Movie on its own is mediocre, but fun. What makes it shine is Tom Hardy's delivery and character portrayal. From when he thinks he is going insane, to when he accepts the symbiote, its all powerful acting and line delivery. In a Marvel universe believable characters are hard to pull off, but this hits the mark.",NA

The fact that he fights someone to not destroy Earth, because he likes his new home is not an Antihero, it is a Villain fighting for turf.

It was such a nice surprise bc we weren’t expecting this. The movie was hilarious and not overly serious at all! The fact that venom and Eddie argue is hilarious.

Venom,Complete lack of depth,kurt france,23-Feb-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,"Very little to like, some humor but that is about it.  The plot and actions of most of the characters made little sense.

Venom,Majorly Flawed Yet Fun,Jonathan Passow,17-Oct-18,,3,"As a whole, the movie is a terrible mess with countless plot holes. However, if you turn your brain off, its a boarder line decent popcorn summer film. The interaction between Eddie and Venom is really the best part and while the end cameo obviously sets up a sequel, we may never get it since Disney is purchasing Fox and all it's rights to these characters. If this version of Venom never shows up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe I would be completely ok with that.",20
Venom,cheeeeeesy,Stephen L.,13-Jan-19,Verified Purchase,2,Way to ruin  really good character in the Spider-Man universe. The movie was lame and uninteresting. I actually passed out twice trying to watch it. Only the third time did I force myself through it to know how lame it was,1

Venom,"Despite its flaws, Venom proves to be a different type of super hero movie that has much potential",HolyJIEbus,7-Oct-18,Format: Prime Video,4,"Comic Book Movie Non-spoiler Review (7.5/10)VenomDirector: Ruben FleischerWriters: Jeff Pinkner, Scott RosenbergStarring: Tom Hardy (Eddie Brock/Venom), Michelle Williams (Anne Weying), Riz Ahmed (Carlton Drake), Jenny Slate (Dr. Dora Skirth)Plot: The Life Foundation CEO Carlton Drake has discovered a new life form: the symbiote! This parasytic symbiote fuses with San Francisco based renowned journalist Eddie Brock and Drake wants his property back - no matter what he has to do or who he has to kill...Review: I am a fan of the Venom character and I have read his comics, bought his action figures, and even played video games with him as a playable character in ""Maximum Carnage"" and ""Separation Anxiety"" on the SNES. With that being said I would have been happy with him just being portrayed better than the Venom in ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007); and I am happy to say that Hardy knocks it out of the park and then some with this movie despite its flaws. Once Brock gets the symbiote, the move becomes a no holds barred visceral action movie with savage action scenes. Although the movie is rated PG-13, it has a high body count and pushes the rating to the limit. This movie even had elements of body horror and horror genre elements that made the movie creepy enough to give it an edge and tone that made it stand out compared to other super hero movies. Hardy's schizophrenic interactions with the Venom symbiote was also a great treat that gave the movie some comedic moments as well as some weight to the plot as I came to appreciate their relationship. Essentially, Hardy played a hapless reporter who was at the wrong place and wrong time, and who must now deal with the consequences of his actions as well as the homicidal symbiote that gave him the power to protect himself and those around him. With that being said the majority of the weaknesses of the film plagued the movie before Brock came into contact with the symbiote. Drake was a one note mustache twirling villain. I never bought the fact that Weying and Brock were a couple who were about to tie the knot, and Williams and Hardy had no real chemistry and their relationship felt forced. It felt like the movie was spending too much time telling me Brock and Weying loved each other rather than showing me that they loved each other. Also, one could tell that the producers were trying to delay Brock from getting the symbiote as last as possible to compensate for their budget. Special effects cost alot of money and although Venom looked good, there wasn't enough of him in the movie and it showed. A high speed chase with lots of special effects? Brock will run away from his pursuers, but only use the powers of Venom without him turning into Venom. Venom needs to get away and dive into the ocean? Then lets have him turn into Brock as soon as he pops out of the ocean. Shortcuts like these were apparent to me to keep the budget of the movie as low as possible. Hopefully, if this movie succeeds the studio will authorize a bigger budget and let the creators go crazy the Venom special effects in a subsequent sequel. Depsite the movie's shortcomings, it was a fun ride and the special effects that it incorporated were top notch. I already watched it twice in IMAX so you know I enjoyed it. Would I say that it's one of the best super hero movies ever made? Nope. Or even one of the movies of the year? Nope, but I had fun watching it and if you're a fan of the Venom character or super hero movies, I think that this was a nice variation of the genre. ",9
Venom,Do yourself a favor and let Venom In,Jess,8-Oct-18,,4,"While this movie ain’t no Logan I believe it has the potential to carve a world a tad more mysterious for Sony’s MCU.Haters of the film are critiquing Venom far harsher than it deserves, it’s easily more enjoyable than most orgin stories and shows a side of Eddie/Venom causal fans haven’t seen.While it has flaws it’s very likely that the 30-40min cut would ease some complaints. Not that it would stop the Haters. Just do yourself a favor and go watch the film and decide for yourself.Also anyone reviewing this product on amazon so low should honestly save their critiques for review websites instead, or at least till the product posted reaches their home. Why try to hinder preorder sales of a movie when it’s the purchase of its physical media that those who enjoyed the film show support.",10

Venom,Movie was bad,Sofoklis,26-Oct-18,,1,"Think hulk 1&2 + spawn.Tom Hardy is a great actor. He is mediocre here but its not his fault ( where the heck is the amazing taboo 2nd season?)Bad plot, story, editing and direction...And no supporting charactersThink of the villain like lex luthor in dawn of justice— not intimidating and not threatening.I knew it was not going to be great but didnt expect it that bad. Follows the classic boring super hero formula and its not funny- just like the movies mentioned above- oh I laughed with Stan Lee!Spiderman 3 is a master piece comoared to this one- not implying that S3 was bad",6

Venom,Nickelodeon Venom: Says Three Phrases!,Frank Castle,21-Dec-18,Format: Prime Video,1,"Terrible movie.  Venom--an authentic alien name we have to take for granted--has the voice of prostate cancer: sometimes English and intelligent, sometimes American and stupid, sometimes childish, sometimes animalistic, ALWAYS ridiculous.The violence is toned down to pre-school level.  No blood.  No gore.  Nothing to fear.The CGI battles are annoying, seizure-inducing, and childlike.  And there are a lot of them.The CGI that springs from Eddie Brock throughout the movie often does not look real or aligned properly with the actor.  When Brock talks face to face with the symbiote, it's obvious that the actor is looking elsewhere.  Really amateur mistake.Furthermore, the main character (Brock) initiates basically nothing.  Venom is the Deus Ex Machina, saving him all the time.  So, the story is boring.The antagonist is a wimpy Indian kid who is supposed to be an evil Elon Musk.  Then, in Act 3 he merges with another symbiote with a terribly childish name.  We have no reason to fear him.  We have no reason to fear the aliens.  We are given no information on the dorky Indian Elon Musk or the symbiotes.  Just that they need hosts to live on Earth.  Well, woop-dee-doo.Then the obligatory love story is so stupid, rapid, and unbelievable that you will feel like the movie has a genuine metaphorical tumor.  The destroyed love subplot is literally a TOOL the writers use to get a doctor into the story and show us that Venom hates MRI scans.Venom begins the movie as a monster, then evolves into a parasitic invader, then devolves into a comedic alter ego, then becomes Brock's buddy.  For no reason.  No. Reason.The movie is a shining example of how to ruin a fantastic comic book villain.",3

Venom,trippy black ooze,H. Bala,7-Oct-18,Format: Prime Video,3,"Watching VENOM is like stepping into a time machine, and that could be taken as a compliment or a dis. VENOM is a throwback to the campy aesthetic of superhero movies circa 1990s, before Nolan and the MCU and WONDER WOMAN made superhero movies a viable, critically acclaimed thing. With that said, VENOM is not as trash as most critics have said. It's far from a good movie, but it has bits that are wildly entertaining. I laughed a lot, although, okay, some of the humor comes unintentionally because of the way the movie was cut. There's a scene in which two people are talking, and, in the background, you see an extra put a hand to his face, like he's just done with this. My theater audience got a good chuckle out of that.I'm not one of those Lady Gaga fanatics crapping on this movie to uplift her movie. But I say Sony goofed again. VENOM suffers from studio interference, from extensive reshoots and choppy editing, and a bonehead script. The scene transitions are awful. And it isn't until around the 45 minute mark that our toothy anti-hero shows up, 45 minutes during which I found myself drifting and chafing for the plot to move along already. I give no sh-ts about the Life Foundation. Michelle Williams, who can act her ass off, is wasted.It's an origin story that deviates drastically from the source material. The most glaring swerve is the absence of Spidey. Note that Sony opted for a PG-13 rating because the plan is to have Spider-Man meet Venom somewhere down the pipe, and I guess you can't have the wallcrawler popping up in an R-rated flick.Still, the demotion to PG-13 doesn't hurt the movie as much as I'd thought. When Venom gets to wrecking sh-- up, it's all good. For those who were wondering, yessir, Venom does get to eat people. The body count is impressive. The violence teeters on the visceral.The best part is the dynamics between Eddie Brock and Venom. I'm shocked that there is actual progression in their relationship, that the both of them snag solid character work. Tom Hardy is one hell of a quirky performer. In the comics, I didn't give a what about loser reporter Eddie Brock. And I still don't. But Hardy does some interesting things. Venom is appropriately odd and deranged. I appreciate that, at times, the film achieves a classic body horror vibe.The ending is a letdown, but isn't that the case with superhero cinema, mostly? Even WONDER WOMAN, 99% a terrific movie, presents a final battle that is CG-heavy and is visually impersonal and just meh. It's a toss-up whether you'll like this movie. Do you like the aesthetics of '90s throwbacks like SPAWN, or THE PHANTOM, THE SHADOW, DARKMAN or Affleck's DAREDEVIL? What kind of sense of humor do you have? Are you a stickler for the source material? I thought Jenny Slate was decent as a scientist. I thought the bad guy was crap. It's a sloppy, campy mess, and some people are into that like they are into train wrecks.There are two end credit stingers. First one sets up the plot for a possible sequel (but I'm not okay with who was cast in the role of--). The second stinger should be called ""Meanwhile, in a good film..."" It's an extended scene for SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDERVERSE that runs three and a half minutes and got me even more stoked for its Christmas release date.Sony is so desperate about creating its own viable corner of the shared Marvel universe, it doesn't mind scraping the bottom of the barrel. I dunno about the IPs it's trying to bring to the screen. I hear they're making a MORBIUS THE LIVING VAMPIRE movie, a KRAVEN THE HUNTER movie, and a SILVER & BLACK movie (which would feature Silver Sable and Black Cat). What's next? A solo film starring the Spot? What about Frog-Man? Stilt-Man? Hypno-Hustler and his Mercy Killers? Aunt May the Movie?",6
Venom,Venom Is What Its Name Implies,William Hefner,16-Dec-18,Format: Prime Video,2,"I'm really surprised that this movie was ever released and not in a good way. This movie had one of the most uneven, badly written scripts that I have ever had to sit through. The pacing is outright horrible. Like it was written by someone with ADD. The CGI was so overwhelmingly annoying that it made my skin crawl.From what I have read it seems that this film was not only the result of a really bad screenplay but was pretty much butchered in the editing process. It seemed as if there were large gaps in the story line that just didn't make much sense and the whole film just seemed kind of incomplete.Then there's the confusing back-and-forth mix of what at times seems like your average Marvel Comic Universe story and when it begins to delve into the R-Rated format of the Deadpool films. This movie can't really seem to figure out what universe it fits into and as a result seems choppy and uneven.Tom Hardy's role is played so over the top that it is pretty much a parody of itself. I have no idea what the director was thinking in this case. He just made the character end up being so unbelievable that you couldn't really sympathize with him or take the plot seriously. I know that the film is based on a comic book, but in reality comic books are not nearly this cheesy.The film definitely had some amusing moments. It was mildly entertaining, but not something that I would ever want to watch again. I've seen many of the Marvel movies several times and still find them enjoyable. Honestly, I didn't really want to sit through all of this movie the first time I watched it, but I have this annoying habit of watching films to the end no matter how bad they are. This once I very nearly ended up turning off.",2

Venom,WASTE OF MONEY,ViaVeritas,12-Dec-18,Format: Prime Video,1,"I now realize the vast majority of reviews left before the movies digital release are FAKE!!! I made the mistake of purchasing this movie based on the reviews, believe me when I say it is NOT WORTH BUYING. Let's put it this way, if the 4 and 5 star reviews aren't fake, just to manipulate people into spending their money, then the reviewers are brain dead morons that no one should ever listen to anyway. Venom is extremely slow to develope the character, there is very little action and what little action there is barely entertains. Everything about the movie feels low budget, the dialogue is cheesy and repetitive, the storyline has tons of gaps and unanswered questions. There's nothing new or memorable about the action scenes, venom is like a cross between the Hulk and the Dr Strange cape. On the one hand Venom does as he pleases with no regard for subtlety and at the same time he protects his host from unforseen dangers. But like I said nothing he does is new, we've seen it all before. This is Venoms fault, this is the writers/directors fault. This is without a doubt the absolute worst Marvel movie made so far. Why the franchise invests so much time and effort into making some of the movies amazing and then allows mediocre movies like this to be made completely baffles me.",2
Venom,Critics Have No Idea What They're Talking About,Ravenhoot,9-Dec-18,,5,"Ignore every negative comment from critics. This is one of those examples where the critics picked a film apart and were so nitpicky but didn't truly understand the viewer base.As a longtime Marvel fan, I absolutely loved this movie. Saw it twice in theaters and already have it preordered. Yes, it's different from the comics, but so are pretty much ALL of the Marvel movies.Tom Hardy is phenomenal. There's a repertoire between Eddie and Venom that I hadn't expected to be so snarky and funny.I went in expecting something dark and serious like Dark Knight Rises and I got something delightfully entertaining like Thor Ragnarok. I was completely pleased with it.",3
Venom,He has a parasite,E. A. Solinas,22-Oct-18,,3,"Ah, Venom. One of the most popular antiheroes of the Marvel world - a toothy, oily alien symbiotic creature bonded to a human being.And despite the fact that Spider-Man is currently grazing in Marvel pastures, Sony went right ahead and created a movie revolving around this character. ""Venom"" is not a particularly good movie - the first third or so is rather dull, actually - but there's a certain manic, bizarre charm to the overall story that makes it at least interesting to watch. If nothing else, watch it for Tom Hardy's continuously strange performance - the man acts like he's suffering from a case of the flu medicated with Jagermeister.Eddie Brock (Hardy) is a determined journalist out to expose the Life Foundation and its CEO, the Elon-Musk-like Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). What he doesn't know is that Drake's space exploration ventures have brought a number of goopy alien organisms to Earth, and one of them has escaped. After Brock's attempts to expose Drake leads to him losing his job and his fiancee (Michelle Williams), he's contacted by a scientist who promises to show him something truly terrible.But when he tries to free a woman from a Life Foundation lab, a black goo merges with his body. He starts feeling and acting strangely, and hearing a voice inside his head. Oh, and tentacles sprout from his body.Yes, one of the alien symbiotes has bonded with him, and Eddie quickly discovers that Venom will take deadly action to avoid being captured by Carlton's thugs... and often just because it thinks mayhem is fun. Unfortunately, Carlton is still looking for the two, and... well, remember that lost symbiote who escaped from him? It's back, and bad things are starting to happen because of it. It will take both Eddie and Venom to save the Earth.Let's be clear: ""Venom"" is not a good movie. It's hokey, full of hoary old cliches and has major consistency issues that go blithely unaddressed (supposedly symbiotes are only compatible with certain people... yet one of them hops merrily from person to person with no problem). But it's almost so bad that it's good, because it has some truly baffling creative choices and performances, and becomes weirdly entertaining when the titular symbiote enters the story.In all honesty, the first part of ""Venom"" is pretty dull - it's mostly Eddie bumbling around San Francisco and reflecting on his bad decisions, interspersed with Carlton being sinister and egomaniacal as he tries to successfully merge a human and symbiote. Things start getting interesting when Eddie gets gooped, and starts doing things like leaping into lobster tanks to eat raw crustaceans - I'm not sure if wacky black comedy was what director Ruben Fleischer was going for, but he achieved it.From there onward, it becomes somewhat more interesting with skull-cracking fights, tentacle-filled motorcycle rides, SWAT team attacks, and some baffling writing that never quite makes sense (Eddie refers to Venom as being ""up my [butt]""). Most importantly, it becomes a sort of odd-couple movie in which Brock and Venom constantly play off one another, with Venom as the mocking head-biting carnivore whom Brock is trying to keep in check (""No, we do not eat policemen!""), and who is inexplicably won over to the good side by Eddie's... um... something. He's also very invested in Eddie getting back together with Anne.Tom Hardy's performance in this movie is... utterly fascinating to me. He looks unkept and slightly glassy-eyed, and plays Eddie Brock with a strange lack of direction and a rambling speaking manner, almost as if he's making up his dialogue as he goes along (""My legs were broken, and now they're not broken""). It's like he has mild food-poisoning and is mildly drunk, and trying to act through both. This might be more understandable if this was only how he acted after joining with the symbiote, but... nope. He's like this throughout the whole movie. It's almost mesmerizing how weird he is.And his weirdness is actually kind of welcome beside the other characters, who tend to be a lot less compelling. Williams is utterly stock as the exasperated ""normal"" ex-girlfriend alienated by Eddie's Srs Journalism, but who still cares about him, and Jenny Slate is vaguely nervy and twitchy in every line she utters. And Ahmed is so transparently, relentlessly evil that he's nearly fun to watch in his two-dimensional mustache-twirling villainy; you half expect him to tie Williams to the railroad tracks and set fire to an orphanage.It's predictable, it's cliched, but ""Venom"" has some eccentric creative choices that are ultimately fun in a perverse way - if nothing else, watch it for the toothy symbiote and his obsession with head-biting.",5
Venom,"Lightweight, but fun",jww,6-Oct-18,Format: Prime Video,3,"Venom is a bit of a mishmash of good and bad ideas, but ultimately I was entertained.Odd attempt at a New York accent aside, Tom Hardy was pretty likable as down-on-his-luck reporter Eddie Brock. The chemistry between him and Venom, an alien symbiote, is surprisingly good considering that half the time Venom is just a voice in Brock's head. Heck, the inhuman, cannibalistic creature is rather charming and funny.Venom looks great too. I was worried, because the original comic design wasn't the easiest thing to adapt to live-action, but they really nailed it here. Venom is this 'roided goo creature with a shark mouth and he looks great. The action is inventive. Director Ruben Fleischer has a good eye for scenery and lighting; there's one scene in the woods that is particularly well-shot.On the other hand, the film waits far too long to introduce Venom. There were a lot of parts that could've been cut or shortened. The main villain is super-weak, both in performance, dialogue, and general competence. Justice League's Steppenwolf, Thor: the Dark World's Malekith, and X-Men's Apocalypse were all stronger villains that this. Jenny Slate as a scientist is given nothing but trash dialogue. Whenever the scene is on these two, you're desperately wishing they'd go back to Brock.This is isn't a perfect film, but I walked in expecting to be entertained and I was.P.S. Be sure to stay through all the credits.",1
Venom,"Entertaining, very memorable, but too short.",bonnie petter,23-Oct-18,Format: Blu-ray,4,"This movie is quite fun.  People complain that there is too much setup, but I thought it was well paced and built very well toward finally seeing the full reveal of venom.  The romance sub-plot was treated in a very low key manner and it worked.  People say that they don't understand the relationship between them in the movie, why would this lawyer be with this scruffy reporter, but there are plenty of real world relationships that follow this dynamic.  When Eddie meets his ex-fiancees new love interest, the new guy is a really genuine person who is polite to eddie and willing to help him when Eddie starts losing control.  A very fresh departure from typical movie tropes.But, THE MOVIE IS TOO SHORT !!!!!  That is the main complaint.  It needed several more scenes of Eddie and Venom together.  Could just be them fighting randos on the street, but it needed more bonding moments between Eddie and Venom so that the line where Venom tells eddie that he's the reason he wants to stay on Earth would have had more impact as you'd have more time to see the character grow from just wanting to invade Earth with Riot.  I hope sony releases an extended cut since the movie has been a hit and exceeded initital box office predictions.",1
Venom,Nasty From Start To Finish,J. Clarkson,7-Jan-19,Format: Blu-ray,1,"This movie is a stinker. Poorly written, poorly directed, and bad CGI. Tom Hardy (who I really respect as an actor) is lost in this. He plays a doofus, and his character, a well know reporter, definitely should not be a doofus. But that's just part and parcel of this nasty cinematic suppository: it's so bad on every single level that it's incoherent. There's some movies that are so bad you really enjoy watching them. This one takes itself so seriously, is plotted so slowly–the two other people watching this stink biscuit with me fell asleep in the middle–that there simply is no redemption to be found anywhere.

They succeeded in that aim...

Venom,"REALLY bad, but watchable.",Nomad3304,10-Jan-19,Format: Blu-ray,2,"The first 30 mins or so could have been condensed to about 3 minutes worth of movie.  I almost fell asleep it was so slow.Tom Hardy is easily one of the best actors of our generation, but the writing and direction of this film turned him into generic Marvel actor #47.  The special effects are fairly average, nothing better or worse than most comic book movies these days.  Majority of the lines are really cheesy, but a couple of jokes work BECAUSE they are so bad.  I agree that this movie really should have been rated R, like the Marvel and DC movies back in the day.  It would have worked better as an R.The movie was a one and done for me (glad I used Redbox).  I would highly suggest renting/streaming it over buying it, as it’s VERY cringey, even for a marvel movie.  Also, if you’re familiar with South Park, Eddie sounds a lot like Kyle’s cousin Kyle from the show.  Also, the Eminem song at the end might be the cringiest part of the whole movie!  RENT FIRST!",1

Not just of the movies, but I’ve read just about every comic book that Spider-Man and Venom have been in. So when I say that there wasn’t anything redeemable about this movie, it spoke volumes to the people that know me. I’ll never watch this movie again. I couldn’t believe that a script was written and approved. There are amazing actors like Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams in this movie, but even they delivered a poor performance. Awful movie.

Venom,HERO MIXTURE,Mark Turner,4-Jan-19,Format: Blu-ray,4,"If you’re a fan of the Spider-man comic books then you know who Venom is. An alien at one time attached to Spider-man and then later transferred to tarnished news reporter Eddie Brock who blamed Spider-man for his lot in life. Thus he became the villain known as Venom. But most of that is abandoned for the movie version, VENOM, and it works well.A space shuttle owned by the Life Foundation is returning to Earth when something goes wrong. The shuttle crashes in Malaysia and all crew members save one are found dead. While being transported to a nearby hospital the sole survivor awakes, kills the ambulance crew and escapes on foot. Within the shuttle one container remained intact and is sent back to the home base for Life Foundation in San Francisco.Moving forward we find Brock (Tom Hardy) doing well for himself. He’s about to marry the woman of his dreams Ann Weying (Michelle Williams) who works as an attorney for the Life Foundation and who has helped him score an interview with the CEO of the company Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). When Brock begins asking questions about human tests being done by the company the interview ends. The result is Drake ruining Brock’s life, taking away his job and firing Ann who leaves him.Tests were being done on humans. It seems the container held an alien symbiote, a creature that attaches itself to a host in order to remain alive. The problem is finding a suitable host to match the creature. Non-matched subjects result in a terrible death with the symbiote seeking a new host.Months later, down on his luck, cowering at the least sign of danger and drinking away his life Eddie is approached by Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) who works for Life Foundation. Seeing the compulsive attitude and lack of care for life exhibited by Drake she wants to help Brock expose what’s taking place. She sneaks him into the research facility where Brock recognizes a homeless friend being used. Breaking her free it turns out the symbiote is inside of her but transfers to Brock. Taking over he helps him escape the guards.Confused and frightened Brock reaches out to Ann for help. Now dating a doctor they both attempt to find out what’s wrong with Brock having no clue about the symbiote. At the same time Drake and his black ops team are trying to find Brock as well. When push comes to shove the symbiote who calls himself Venom comes forward to protect Brock and take on the bad guys.While all of this is taking place remember the symbiote who escaped at the beginning of the film? It’s made its way to San Francisco as well. Its intent is to use Drake to get what it wants, a way off the planet to reach the rest of his race with the intent of taking over the planet. Guess who stands in his way?The movie works on a number of levels here. The setup is easily understood and the demarcation lines between bad guys and good guys are set. At the same time when Venom makes his presence known he becomes an anti-hero of sorts, feeding on the bad guys he takes on, most often biting off their heads. Guess it shows that it doesn’t pay to be a bad guy.But the movie has a unique combination of horror, action, comic book heroics and humor that works well and blends nicely. Brock complains and has no clue what’s going on as Venom sprouts forth and takes over to go hand to hand with the black ops members. He isn’t happy about being a repository for the creature either. But as the two combine and learn more about one another, as Venom helps heal the issues Brock has going on inside of him they come together to save the world or die trying. Venom even reveals something about himself I won’t disclose here that makes them a perfect match.There is little doubt that the main thing driving this film is the current interest in comic book based films combined with special effects that would not have been possible to film when the comics first created the character. Yes the effects are amazing. But let’s not forget that Hardy is an amazing actor and he brings to the Eddie Brock something we’ve not seen him do in the past. He makes the character not just human but funny at times. It makes for a more interesting character and Hardy makes it work spectacularly.A little bit of language will make this a movie that the smallest of children might want to bypass as well as the character being a bit frightening for tykes. But it’s a blast and a fun ride for everyone else and one to enjoy more than once.",NA

Venom,Why are they still making superhero movies this poor?,B&S About Movies,28-Dec-18,Format: Prime Video,2,"Directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad), Venom has appeared on plenty of worst of lists this year. I held back judgment until I saw the movie. I can sum it up in one word: underwhelming. But after all, who was clamoring for a Venom movie after Spider-Man 3? Who was needing one in 2018? And after the magic of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, why do filmmakers feel they can still be so lazy with superheroes?That said, Venom is critic proof. After all, it was a box office success, ultimately earning $855 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 2018.It all comes down to one good thing: Tom Hardy. It's like this dude has to have the craziest voices in movies. His Eddie Brock voice is just the most need to please accent ever, while Venom, in his own words, is a ""James Brown lounge lizard."" The relationship between these two characters -- who become one person -- is the best part of the movie. Hardy also improvised a lot, such as when he jumps into a lobster tank to cool down. I kind of love that the dude was pretty much making up his own film. The actor claimed that he based his performance on Woody Allen, Conor McGregor and Redman.Everything else -- from the villains to Eddie Brock's relationships -- is as generic as it gets. Big points for having Jenny Slate in here, even if she does nothing. It's like the film felt it had to give us an origin when all we want to see is Venom break stuff. The end of the film, where he eats a criminal and meets Cletus ""Carnage"" Kasady (and come on, who doesn't want to watch Woody Harrelson against Hardy in a battle of accents and overacting) is exactly what everyone really wants, not nearly two hours of generic soldiers and Venom battling Elon Musk.In the spin of selling this movie, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch claimed that ""Venom was considered a spin on a horror film, inspired by the works of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg, but with more pop and fun."" People that say these kinds of things have never seen films by these two directors. Get their words out of your mouth and make better movies.The hard part of this whole thing is that there's a tease of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which will either make you say, ""I should have just watched that"" or ""Man, that was such a better movie.""",NA

Venom,Ok but falls a bit short in my opinion,JWINK,2-Feb-19,Format: Prime Video,3,"Venom is one of those characters in the Marvel universe that I only vaguely know about, mostly as a foe to Spiderman.  With that being said, I can understand that the film has to introduce the character, although it takes the majority of the film to get there.  I am also not so sure why Venom is being introduced as a hero type character as I have always known him to be a villain.Tom Hardy is ok in the role as Eddie Brock and the interaction between Venom and Brock does have its funny moments at times.  The story feels a bit flat and generic to me, with its standard formulaic plot line.  It almost seems to me that the writers were not really sure what direction that they wanted to take the character and the story.  Also, in what is unusual for today’s movies, I thought the CGI for Venom was not particularly good and looked cheaply done.Overall, the movie is an ok popcorn watch, but to me fell a bit short and could have had a better storyline instead of the generic, formulaic one it had.3 stars",NA

The foreshadowing was obvious and I just couldn't relate or care about ANY of the characters, including Hardy. The best part of the whole movie was Stan Lee's final cameo. This movie is a major stumble in what has been extremely entertaining and well developed story lines in the Marvel Universal of movies. Watch the trailer instead of the movie. All the best parts are in those three minutes. Very disappointing.",NA
Venom,Another origins movie....okay,zerofaith,23-Dec-18,Format: Prime Video,3,"I don't know how to intricately dissect a bland origins movie okay, but I do know I just saw one.  Bad CG, lame main villain,  waste of time first act that we have to get through to actually get to the movie, generic romance plot with disposable female lead, teaser ending that might have been hype except its also PG-13 in a genre they they have MANY TIMES proven will make bank with R, and by the way totally should have been for this movie.  All of this could have been a good movie but nope just a by the numbers comic book ""here's the next one"".  Ironman had a charismatic lead, Dr. Strange had fantastic visuals,  Black Panther....well Black Panther didn't do a generic origins plot.  My point is that there are things you can do to make your X character starter movie good, and this movie does none of them.  Was it bad? No, but I wouldn't call it good either.",NA
Venom,"Better than I thought it'd be, BUT...",Mike Johnson,19-Dec-18,,3,"I honestly didn't go into Venom expecting much given 1) Sony's recent record with its Marvel properties prior to this fall and 2) the fact that they didn't have Marvel Studios there to shoulder the load like they did with Spider-Man: Homecoming.Still, I wanted to see it as a fan of Marvel's characters and given that I usually enjoy the work of both Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams.  And while Venom was certainly better than I expected, it still seemed lacking in a lot of ways.**There might be very minor spoilers below**Pros:- the ""conversations"" between and Eddie Brock and Venom were probably the highlight of the film for me (they probably should've had more of them because they actually brought some humor and life to the film)- this kind of ties into the above, but I really liked their overall presentation of the Venom symbiote (they really flesh it out so to speak)Cons:- it took around half the film for me to even feel the slightest bit invested in the story- character development seemed non-existent to me (which seems like a waste of the talented cast)- people rag on MCU films for having ""bland"" villains that they don't care about, but the villain in Venom takes the cake in my opinionConclusion:I still wish Sony would sell all the Spider-Man rights back to Marvel Studios (though Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse looks good, which seems fitting since I think we'll see Miles Morales in the same universe as Tom Hardy's Venom before we see Tom Holland's Peter Parker from the MCU).",NA
Venom,Fun Film,James N Simpson,25-Jan-19,,5,Don't read superhero comics so preconceived notion of what what Venom should be in this origin movie.  For me it was fun movie about a journalist who by his own stupidity gets himself fired and severs any chance he had of hooking up with the woman who looks like she's wearing a wig that he wants to.  His want to get vengeance on the man he holds responsible ends up with him with a critical sarcastic voice in his head.  I thought this was an awesome concept and for an origin story I didn't expect Venom as a character to emerge until a fair way in so wasn't disappointed with that.  I was happy with what we see when it did.  I thought the awkward scenes with the voice in his head that makes him hungry for alive things like lobsters were actually the scenes that made this such an entertaining film.,NA
Venom,Don't listen to the critics,G Ninja,20-Dec-18,,5,"I missed out on this movie in theaters because of the poor critic reviews. But as I started to hear that fans and moviegoers gave this mostly positive reviews I rented it from redbox. Am I glad I did. This movie is a great standalone movie with no attachment to any other marvel super heroes. Tom Hardy was great as Venom and the relationship between the symbiote and himself was hilarious. After watching Avengers and the usual marvel formula, it was good to see something more original. I hope there is a sequel to this movie.",1
Venom,Fun & well balanced between plot and action,NYC212,3-Jan-19,Format: Prime Video,4,"This is a really fun movie!  I'm not familiar with the original storyline so I had no expectations going in and maybe that helped, but the movie went by quickly and was fun to watch.  The actual running time is 1 and 1/2 hours with a mini teaser after four minutes of credits.  The rest of the time is for more credits followed by a brief cartoon of spider man who - I gather from other reviews - is somehow tied to Venom in the original graphic novels.  Tom Hardy was fantastic and the growing friendship between his character and Venom is funny.  I'm not a huge fan of car chase scenes but they didn't overwhelm the screen time so it was fine. This was a great origin story with the promise of more fun in a sequel, which I look forward to watching!",NA
Venom,Tom Hardy?  Wow...,Fabulinus,13-Jan-19,Format: Prime Video,4,"I've been only moderately impressed by the Marvel movies that have come out over the past 10 years.  Most of them are very light on dialog and equally light on acting (lol).  There have been a few exceptions like Iron Man, Thor Ragnarok, and Black Panther, but most are mediocre at best.  Venom, in my opinion, is one of the exceptions.  The acting in this (by all) was excellent, the story moved along at a good pace and it kept my attention straight through!  I thought the dialog of the venom character was a bit too silly, hence 4 stars instead of 5, but overall this was an excellent movie and well worth watching.  Even the title song by Eminem was excellent.  I'll most likely purchase this movie to watch again when I want to.",NA
Venom,Such A Good Movie,North Gate,27-Dec-18,,5,"Me and a friend of mine went to the theatre and watched Venom, loved it the first time I watched it.

Venom,"Terrific Marvel fun, with as much comedy as action and drama.",Howard Ferstler,19-Dec-18,,5,"Loved the film. Hardy is terrific. One oddity, however. The soundtrack for the theater release, at least as listed in the credits at the end, was supposedly configured as Dolby Atmos. (I have a full Atmos and DTSX set up with all the bells and whistles.) However, as listed on the disc box, the Bluray disc is done in DTS HD Master Audio, with 5.1 channels. I find this rather odd for a disc this current. It should have been done in either DTSX (my processor converted the 5.1 to DTS Neural-X, at least) or Dolby Atmos. I assume the 4K release was done with Atmos or DTSX, but the Bluray disc could easily have been done this way, too. No big deal, but a limiting factor with this release.",NA

Venom,Can a movie actually be worse than abysmal expectations going into it? Turns out yes.,Herbert McStinkwrinkle,5-Jan-19,Format: Blu-ray,1,"Usually when I go into a movie expecting the worst, I come out thinking ""that wasn't all that bad"" or it could have been worse. That was the case with Solo, most recent Fantastic4, Justice League, etc. All ended up being better than I expected. I can't believe it but this was actually worse than I expected - way worse... and I really didn't expect much. I normally love Tom Hardy, but here, he acts like a first quarter Drama student, and Williams and Ahmed are both usually great, but can't pull it together here. A lot (not all, but a lot) of the CG looks like about 10+years old... I just can't believe this movie was such a success. It sucked.",NA
Venom,"4.5, closer to 5 than 4",Georg Cantor,20-Dec-18,Format: Prime Video,5,Didn't have any idea what to expect going in and didn't know the characters or back story etc so the plot felt a bit aimless for the first 30-40 minutes but still entertaining. Once the 'superhero powers' were established I was pleasantly surprised by the unique take on the super hero genre. Overall the movie felt like a much more focused version of green lantern. Parts feel a bit cut for time but overall a very good experience.,1
Venom,Surprisingly Good,DK,2-Dec-18,,4,"I was skeptical seeing this film.  With all of it's reports of re-shoots and stuff, I didn't have high expectations for it.  Plus, early screenings weren't that good to which people were saying that there wasn't enough Venom.  But, I am a Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams fan.  So, I went and saw it.  I was surprised on how the movie was entertaining to my friends and I.  I really liked the characters and banter between Venom and Eddie.  I will try and not read about the hype of a film before I see it now.  Lol.  Give it a go.  The first half of the film is a little slow but it picks up and really delivers a great Venom movie.  Can't wait for another one!!!",NA
Venom,"Different, but still Good.",Lori,28-Nov-18,,5,"I understand that not every individual will like certain movies,  but that is why it is important to watch and form your own opinions. I went in and wasn't sure if I would enjoy it. I was pleasantly surprised by what I found and I enjoyed the movie.Eddie has to deal with so much while learning from his mistakes. He has to deal with his new... ""roommate"" and what follows. His journey from having ""everything"" to ""nothing"" and what happens to him is a great story and shows that you have to learn from your mistakes and move on, sometimes with help.I definitely recommend this movie. It's an interesting twist on a favorite symbiote.",NA
Venom,Venom quick movie review,J. Daniel Spratlin,20-Dec-18,,2,"What’s it about?Reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is infected by an alien parasite that gives him superpowers, but shares control of his body.What did I think?Desperately hoping that you’ll assume it’s part of Marvel’s cinematic universe (look, we have a Stan Lee cameo and everything!) Venom is occasionally fun, but not nearly enough to warrant your time. The movie’s best moments are the interactions between Tom Hardy’s Eddie and the “symbiote”, as he discovers the nature of their shared living situation. Sadly these scenes are few and far between, buried in a poorly-written and awkwardly paced mess.",NA
Venom,Major Disappointment,TheSeeker,3-Jan-19,,1,"Awful dialogue, no chemistry, terrible acting, generic 'big corporate' villain, flat jokes, bad physical acting, and to top things off, Mr. Venom also provided dating advice.

Venom,Best queer romcom of the century,Zay,28-Nov-18,,5,"it fails spectacularly as a superhero film, but it hits every mark as an amazing, unique and twisted romcom. I love it.",3
Venom,"Good, not great.",JVII,4-Feb-19,,3,"Venom was good. It’s not the greatest super hero movie ever made, but it’s not the worst. There are some humorous moments between Eddie and Venom, and Tom Hardy does a good job. The CGI was decent as was the story. The comic book crowd will not like this one too much as it takes all of the “bad a$$ery” out of the Venom character, probably for the sake of the general movie audience. Don’t get me wrong - In this movie, Venom does kick quite a lot of butts (Chomp!), but he’s more of an anti-hero/ good guy. Overall, not a bad watch. Spoiler: Spidey doesn’t show up at all, in case you were wondering. ;)",NA
Venom,Absolutely love this movie!,A.Piercy,20-Dec-18,,5,"Ok, so I'm a die hard Marvel Movie fan. That being said, I know people have their own opinions and what might be a great movie to one person, might be a terrible movie to someone else. You can't please everyone. I personally loved this movie and so did my kids. They said that it was their favorite Marvel Movie! Tom Hardy portrays an awesome Venom! I laughed so many times throughout the movie. There are a bit more curse words compared to other Marvel Movies but to me it was nowhere near as bad as Deadpool and it did not have the vulgerness either. Just a FYI for parents. I personally think it's worth a watch. I purchased the movie and will definitely be watching it over many times. To me it's either going to be a movie you love or one you hate. Either way you should give it a try and decide for yourself!",NA
Venom,Spit the venom out,Culture Vulture,13-Jan-19,,2,"With the box office results Venom managed to achieve I had to check it out and it was a big disappointment. Aside from a cool-looking Venom character, I didn't believe any of the characters in their roles. I usually like Tom Hardy in everything he's done but didn't buy him as an investigative/consumer journalist (whatever he was supposed to be) or someone who would be in a relationship with Michelle WIlliams. Surprised he wasn't cruising around on a skateboard. Also didn't buy Riz Ahmed in his role. It all just felt kind of half-hearted and shallow.",NA
Venom,"This Venom is not for fans, but the newer generation",M. Evans,9-Jan-19,,2,"Let me start by stating I dont write reviews very often, I dislike the idea of thinking what I have to say is important enough for the vast internet audience. Frankly I think the concept can become vain, everyone arguing opinions. However, there are times when something in my opinion needs to be explained from a factual, rational position. After viewing Venom and seeing the divide in reviews, I feel the need in this case to explain why some hate it and others, as most reviews here show, loved it.  Ok, I disliked this film, right out the gate. I wanted to like it, mind you. The last time we saw Venom on the screen, it was in the abysmal Spiderman 3 (I still love you Sam Raimi) played by the equally terrible Topher Grace. Ill say now NOTHING will be as bad as that rendition of Venom, so take a little comfort there. Let me explain why I disliked this version. Im a longtime Venom fan. Been reading the comics since I was 12, and Im 35 now, so I know his origins and character. I practically grew up with him and Spiderman. Venom was a villain. Eddie Brock was a criminal. He was a burglar and was prone to physical violence. I remember the beginning of the series Maximum Carnage, Brock was in prison at the time with Cletus Cassidy and thats how he met Carnage, not interviewing him. Brock and Venom killed many people in gruesome ways, and were always out for their own benefit, with the only exception being the few times Venom teamed up with Spidey, mostly to fight the greater evil, Carnage. In this film, Eddie Brock is more of pathetic loser turned antihero, a non-confrontational reporter fighting a crusade against the corporate powers. He seemed way to righteous and likeable, noble even at a certain point. The actual Venom thats been around for 20 years is NONE of those things. The film created a new character out of the framework of the original, and I thought it was vanilla cliche, boring and expected, predictable.  THAT is why I believe reviews are so split. Half the audience knows the Venom character already, the other half dont and are watching this new. Also, the pacing, dialog, character development, cinematography... were very sophomore. As others have stated, the film feels like film students put this together. Just a lack of anything fresh or creative. Tropes tropes tropes on top of cliches and formulaic narratives. Poo poo. It scares me films like this are sitting at 4 stars.",NA
Venom,Listen to the Audiobook instead.,Jake Cosplays,20-Dec-18,,1,"Its a buddy cop movie with a bipolar symbiote venom and disjointed flop to comicbook fans. So much corporate "" but the chart says,... "" where scenes were cut, basic turning away and blackout for R scenes that shouldve made the movie R in the first place. When he eats heads, there far away from the screen or blacked out censerd. The ending credits says theyl have carnage but that will be horrible aswell with a pg13 ratiby and scheduald contract to keep Spider-Man, Tom Holland has to be in the film's sequal to have marvel keep him but that's more gushing the crowed.

So I had a little bit of trepidation, but I actually really enjoyed the movie.You don't have to have a full immersion in the Marvel Universe to understand or appreciate the movie. You get enough backstory to understand what is happening and get a grip on why these characters matter.",NA
Venom,Handsome Actor + Head Eating Alien,S A,13-Jan-19,,4,"What's not to like? A handsome leading actor and a terrifying looking, head eating alien. I read other reviews which were negative because in the comics I guess Venom is always the bad guy but here he's more like a dark hero. Not really good. Not really that bad. I haven't read the comics so I wasn't expecting Venom to be a certain way and I could review this movie with no prejudice. He's a scary looking creature and the action was good. The story line was fun and the movie was entertaining. Definitely worth the rental.",NA
Venom,“Fuel for the tank.”,Einsatz,10-Jan-19,,3,"I am not an aficionado of Marvel characters.  When I started watching this movie I didn’t know what to expect.  I didn’t know whether this was a comedy or a horror film.  It is neither.  The first forty minutes were deadly dull, waiting for something to happen other than the sob story of an unlikeable loser.  By the time Venom finally appears and takes over…  And there you have a movie worth watching…but it’s just the last half.I almost, kind of, sort of liked it at times.  But mostly I didn’t care.  Eh, it was okay.",NA
Venom,First movie I've wanted to rewatch in a long time!,Robert Gregory,8-Dec-18,,4,"It's a flawed, but entertaining experience.  I don't feel like I wasted my time. If you want a horror movie or a tragic heart gripping take on Venom, this is not the film for you. Watch The Incredible Hulk or Old Man Logan instead. If you're going to buy this movie, go into it expecting a scifi buddy cop experience, comedic elements from a B movie, and a cartoony interpretation of Venom.It has the general feel of a comic book movie that was made before the MCU existed, back when Punisher, Blade, and Ghost Rider movies were being made, but it doesn't take itself as seriously as those films and flourishes because of it. Comparing it to current films of the genre, I actually find it more enjoyable than Suicide Squad, the first two Thor movies, Ant Man, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and Iron Man 2.Tom Hardy's performance as Eddie Brock as this confused man who doesn't know what's going on is very likable.",NA
Venom,I assume a 7/10 would be a 3 in stars...,Chris,14-Dec-18,,3,"This movie is lots of fun throughout! It does have a slow, but interesting first 30 min that allows us to get a glimpse of Eddie and his life before meeting Venom. He is an average joe kind of guy who enjoys his life, but screws up when he goes to far while making an investigation in Carlton Drake's work. After six months, he is slightly depressed, but his life is jump started when he meets Venom. When Venom finally makes his way to Eddie for the first time, the movie really picks up to the point and it is great! The story could be a little better, but the best thing about the movie is Eddie and Venom's relationship (and no, not intimate or romantic, which I heard is what happened in the comics). Anne is an ok character, but wish she wasn't so over the top and dramatic about the things that occur in this movie...The actress needs to work on her scared acting..... Carlton is a very wooden and generic villain is who just in the movie to be evil with no real character feel to him. He is just in the movie to be an evil walking talking cheesy definition of an antagonist. On a positive note, Riot makes decent use of him! Riot is the best of the villainy part of this movie, who sadly does not have much screen time, but he is still an okay villain who feels like a character and villain who is also very frightening! Venom knows in this movie that Riot has more physical advantages than he does, but Venom is smart in a fight and has agility as an advantage, along with his strength, even though Riot is a little stronger. That fight in the end was awesome! Hardy nails Eddie and Venom and is the number one best thing about this entire film! I am glad the visuals and cgi holds up! If the cgi was bad, I could not take a bulky big Venom any more serious than the wussy scrawny ""Venom"" in SM3..... Many things in this movie could be done better and some done a little less, but Eddie makes everything work and worth it! I totally prefer this Eddie over some punk Eddie that was shown in the comics and 90s cartoon. I hope, with the $850m this movie won over, they make part 2 better!",NA
Venom,It's Like It's In The MCU But Not...,Devin,13-Jan-19,,4,I liked the movie but it had this weird vibe where it's supposed to be in the MCU but it doesn't quite fit. I mean I can't see Venom joining up with (or against) Spiderman in a later film because it just didn't feel like an MCU movie. It's a cool idea and all where he's more like Deadpool but Deadpool does it within the confines of his character. Venom goes from mass murdering psycho to only bad guy murdering semi-good-guy in the course of like 30 minutes and it just doesn't fit. Good movie though.,NA
Venom,Great family movie.,MOD,9-Dec-18,,5,"It’s good if you’re not being nitpicky. It works for me because I have children and the bad words are minimal but at the same time I guess they’re there for adults. Like all movies they shot for the general audience.

And I’m a huge Tom hardy fan but this performance is so below him. His American accent is incredibly stale. I can’t figure out why anyone is giving this 5 stars.

Venom,This movie is a lot better than everyone said,James Garney,1-Jan-19,,4,"Everyone got their panties in a bunch because Venom, the symbiote, was kind of a dork at times (""On my planet, I was a loser like you""), which flies in the face of him being a demonic killing machine. However, I liked this because it seemed super realistic: Venom needs Brock, and if he goes Insane Monster 3000™ on the world, Brock would just crank up the stereo and blast him to hell. So, on the contrary, I found the symbiote's portrayal refreshingly realistic for how that relationship would have to be if it was truly ""real"".Tone is a bit all-over-the-place, but I didn't mind it. It was at times violent, action-packed, funny, or scary. But it all worked for me.",NA
Venom,A Very Awful Poison!!,Sav Supreme,24-Dec-18,,1,I was so shocked at how bad this film was. First it was way too short.

Shame on you Marvel for not having more vision to make this work..,1
Venom,Don't believe the critics!,Merrie E. Gabriel,18-Dec-18,,5,"For some reason the critics seemed prepared to hate this film and expressed that hatred through scathing reviews. Yes, the film is flawed. The story is cliched at best and silly at worst, but it's the kind of silly that both entertains and amuses as you watch it. Tom Hardy is in fine force, being allowed to show off his comedic side, which is always entertaining. The critics seemed to take the film far more seriously than it was intended--Sony for instance did a tongue-in-cheek trailer for the release re-categorized as a romantic comedy--which was a mistake.

That being said it is worth the purchase, and I don't regret one cent.. but can only give it 3 stars because it was such a good movie, however it varied so greatly from its origins.",NA
Venom,Specimens from Outer Space,Michael A. Lilly,17-Dec-18,,4,"'Life Foundation' sent humans to outer space to find specimens in the hopes of finding cures for human weaknesses and ills, they were able to find on a comet a symbiotic life form. On its return to earth, it's cargo develops a mind of its own and takes over the human life forms aboard causing a chain of events whereby the humans that host the life form become a controlling life force of it's own.",NA
Venom,Waste of Time,Senor Nahuali,23-Jan-19,,1,"Formulaic moronic unrealistic story with cartoon/video game effects.  Marvel/Disney do the same movie over and over and over and over.......Absolutely nothing original. Characters were charicatures. ONe of the worst movies I""ve ever tried to get through. And there are so many these days so not surprised at all. The dumbing down of the Earth's population is well underway.",NA
Venom,Could Have Been So Much More,Mark McLaughlin,1-Jan-19,,3,"This is a bit of an uneven movie for me, it feels like the filmmakers couldn't find the right tone so it lumbers between dark and broody and unnecessarily campy and comedic at points. If this movie had been released with an R rating it certainly could have been much better and the lack of any attachment to the main Marvel cinematic universe will always be a shortcoming IMO.",NA
Venom,Its a good watch,Nancy,28-Jan-19,,4,"Critics panned this movie so much that I was starting to believe them. I should have gone to see it in the theatre's when it first came out to get the whole experience. Its worth the watch and the Stan Lee cameo almost made me teary eyed. Obvi if you think they are going to stick to cannon, you're sadly mistaken, but as a stand alone in the Marvel's Movie franchise, its just fine.",NA
Venom,Disappointed - Sony is bad for the MCU,Ariele,21-Dec-18,,3,"Graphics were fun, Hardy was weak. Usually a big fan of his. Much better in Taboo and Peaky Blinders. Riz Ahmed was a terribly dull and blank and empty and dull villain. If you skim articles with him he comes off as so obnoxious. This boring little man thinks he can be the next bond or hamlet. Hilarious.One highlight was cameo of the late, great Stan Lee.",NA
Venom,Comedies don’t get good reviews. <U+0001F602>,JokesOnYou123,28-Nov-18,,3,"Lets be honest this movie isn’t amazing. It’s pretty terrible but it’s entertaining so if you want something that’s on an Adam Sandler scale then this is the movie for you. So many plot holes, horrible script but man is this movie hilarious.",1
Venom,They are seconds,George(Latinx47) Martinez,6-Jan-19,,3,"I Like the action. Some parts were comedic. Ending sucks..., Venom's complete takeover of our hero's body and soul was not necessary. Lost 2 stars because of it. He obviously died for Venom to take total control.  I enjoyed the movie up on till then. Disappointing ending-- What were the writers thinking to %**$$^ a movie with an ending like that.",NA
Venom,Spawn Was Better,Jack Ryan,20-Jan-19,,2,"Except for the great Tom Hardy, there's not much to recommend about this, and he's not enough to save it. It has moments of humor, but spends way too much time cycling through boring old-school comic-book movie routines. Think Spawn. Actually, come to that, Spawn was better, or at least fresher at the time. A lot of this just felt stale.",NA
Venom,We don't know what this movie was trying to be,J. Hilton,31-Dec-18,,2,"Venom just doesn’t know what it wants to be, and it suffers because of it. The story starts out dark and dramatic, so when it starts throwing jokes around, they feel out of place. The dialogue is corny and the fight scenes are a series of blurry images and quick cuts, which makes the action quickly become tedious. We didn’t like this movie.",NA
Venom,The Movie Venom Deserved,Amazon Customer,18-Dec-18,,5,"Years ago, when Venom was included as a character in Spiderman 3 I felt cheated out of a truly great character. Venom  is the ultimate anti-hero when paired with Eddie Brock. In this film, all the complexities of both the Symbiote and Eddie Brock are introduced and their symbiotic relationship explored with humor, action, and drama. Great film.",NA

Venom,It's not as bad as the reviews made it out to be.,Nick Manix,18-Dec-18,,4,"I don't get why so many people disliked this film. It wasn't the best comicbook/superhero adaptation but it was entertaining and a billion times better than the ""Spider-Man 3"" take on the Venom storyline. I would suggest renting it first for those unsure if they want to own it. But I'm a big fan of the film and hope a sequel is in the works.",NA
Venom,"Great Movie, Tom Hardy was Awesome.",SDAmazon,6-Jan-19,,5,"This movie was great. Tom Hardy was awesome and played the duo role incredibly. Never seen much of him before, but now want to go see what else he has done! Venom was great, anti hero angle that was very well played. Most all the supporting actors were good and over all a very entertaining movie. Ignore the haters and watch it!",NA
Venom,Venomous to your sense of tasteful theater.,paul carilli,14-Jan-19,,1,"Before renting this movie, I was prepared to disagree with the horrific reviews by the critics. After WATCHING this movie, I am NOW more than prepared to agree with the critics. Now I realize just how kind, patient, and generous movie critics really are. The horrible reviews calling this movie a ""trainwreck"" were too subtle. They should invent harsher words just so those of us who have lived through the painful experience of watching this movie can do a better job of describing the experience to our therapists.",NA
Venom,Best movie I've seen in years!,Shelley,12-Jan-19,,5,"We liked this movie so much, we watched it twice in a row and I've never done that!  Hilarious scenes that cracked me up, incredible effects, great acting all around!  The only thing that could have improved this movie would be a decent sound track.  Hope the music is better in the sequel. There HAS to be a sequel!",NA
Venom,"No 3D,  NO SALE",S. Rowley,20-Dec-18,,4,"This is a 3 star movie but for some reason, I enjoyed on a 4-star level. Likely due to Tom Hardy's bonkers performance.I would have gladly bought the 3D Blu-ray, but as Sony has discontinued 3D support, I won't be buying this in any form.C'mon Sony, at least sell 3D to the people who still want it! I exclusively buy 3D these days.",NA
Venom,"Excellent action movie, Tom Hardy is awesome!",LJLee,31-Dec-18,,5,"Strongly recommend you buy the special features. They really show how much work went into this movie blending CGI, and Tom Hardy's characters (Eddie Brock / Venom). It is fantastic and will give you a much better appreciation of his acting. The story line was good, lots of action and enjoyable characters! Loved it!",NA
Venom,Just came in,Ricardo,18-Dec-18,,5,"Since I was a kid  I always liked Venom & Carnage more than spider man. Watched the cartoons back in the 90s. Anyways this movie is great with high quality. I highly recommend getting this for those venom fans out there who were satisfied with the venom in ""spider man 3 with toby McGuire""  this movie with Tom Hardy puts that sucker to shame",NA
Venom,"According to Amazon, Michelle Williams is the star",Scott O'Donnell,17-Dec-18,,4,"First.....why does Amazon NOT list Tom Hardy as the star of Venom? Every listing of Venom on Amazon lists Michelle Williams as the star.The movie was good. We are definitely seeing an age of the anti-hero, unconventional hero.  Would love to see a Venom/Ant-Man movie since they are both in San Francisco.",NA
Venom,Actually good!,bradley d phelan,28-Dec-18,,4,"I dont care for the spiderman movies, and this looked like a bad spin-off, but it was actually pretty good. It was funny even, Venom, the monster, is actually very polite and there are fewer plot holes than many top line action hero movies. The plot also sets itself apart from most others and I am hoping that there will be a sequel.",NA
Venom,Funny and full of Action,JaimeIsaac,30-Dec-18,,4,I loved that the movie was entertaining but it had lots of action. The actor playing venom fit right into the role. And it seems that the villain died when the spaceship exploded but who knows what they will bring back when there is a sequel. I did not like that the female doctor did not make it to the end.,NA
Venom,thought it was funny,Rachel,18-Dec-18,,5,"Bit of a slow start but entertaining once he is infected. Alien dialogue got lots of laughs. 'A pile of bodies and a pile of heads.' I laughed way too long at that. So matter of fact. Tom Hardy was good in this. All I really knew him as from before is Bane, so I didn't know he was funny, but the apartment and restaurant scene was great - I can only imagine what it must have been like on set having to do all that in front of everyone.",NA
Venom,You'll NEVER EVER LOSE Interest,Hannah,31-Jan-19,,5,"I wasn't sure about at first before I started watching it, yet since it began I never once lost interest in it. It's by far my favorite character & movie out of all the marvel movies. Great job you guys this is definitely a master piece!!! Everything truly came together great & this guy truly had me laughing my butt off!! It was almost like you were watching him in real life..LoL. He truly knows how to grasp the attention of his audience truly captivating you drawing you in without just teasing you & letting you go he keeps your attention every step of the way. I'm glad venom sticks around with him too & I'm excited to see what comes next!! Thank you so much for being you!!!!",NA
Venom,"GREAT, hilarious and dark--my favorite!",Kelly Ashton,28-Oct-18,,5,"Dark humor, great acting, SPOT ON script. Hillarious kind of buddy-cop movie but a sarcastic, murdering alien symbiote and a kinda loser journalist. It's just freaking amazing! If you like Marvel at ALL then see this. It's Marvel but a little something else that I cannot quite put my finger on but it's amazing!Only if you like dark humor hahah",NA
Venom,Die Hard Venom Fan,Amazon Customer,26-Dec-18,,1,This is a review from someone who wanted to like this movie more than the average comic fan. Netflix Marvel shows have better graphics than this. Bad acting. Bad script. Don't waste your money like I did...,1
Venom,"Not a good movie, but a wonderfully fun movie.",Kindle Customer,22-Dec-18,,4,"No, it's not Oscar material. But darned if watching this wasn't quite a blast.  While there's a bit of a slow start, once the Venom/Brock combo starts rolling, it's just pure ridiculous fun.  Hardy goes all out and manages to be both amazing and terrible all at once, resulting in a campy, enjoyable buddy cop/monster/alien movie mashup that never takes itself too seriously.",NA
Venom,SECOND WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,Suzanne Schumacher,25-Dec-18,,1,"I say this is the second worst movie, of all time, only because there HAS to be one worse.  Maybe.  Can’t believe it cost $20!  What a ripoff.",1
Venom,Great Time,A Strong Poet,27-Oct-18,,5,These actors pull this movie off with its plot holes and comic book story which is astounding. Hardy and Riz Ahmed are consummate professionals. Mesmerizing. Michelle Williams is great. I went with my son not expecting to like it one bit and I bought in from the very beginning.  Well done all around guys.,NA
Venom,Fun movie,Curtice Morris,27-Jan-19,,4,"I don't understand why critics gave it such bad reviews, I thought it was really good. Venom looked great compared to the Spider-Man 3 Venom. Has more comedy in it than I originally thought, but most of the time it doesn't feel forced. I recommend buying this movie if you like superhero movies.",NA
Venom,Comment of Product vs Comment of the Movie,Peter Smigelski,7-Jan-19,,3,"I've been reading through many of the reviews for this movie, and found 99% of them extremely disappointing. While I understand (and mostly agree with) many of the criticisms for the actual movie, but there are lots of other aggregate sites that already review the movie itself. I would like to ask those who review this, to actually just review the product, ie whether the product has special features, what those features are, whether there are different features on different formats (dvd vs blu-ray vs 4k - streaming) the quality of the picture and sound of those formats. Thank you",NA
Venom,The Critics Were Dead Wrong,Maverick,1-Jan-19,,5,"I didn't watch this in the movies because of all the poor reviews, but I ended up picking the 4K version at Best Buy for New Year's day because I wanted to watch a movie with ATMOS.  Great decision.  I actually rate it 4.5 stars, but this should offset some of the biased reviews with unwarranted low ratings.  Video and Audio quality were amazing.  The black saturation was spot on, and overhead speakers made the experience immersive.  In short, go buy this movie and enjoy a fun flick.  This was one of the better Marvel movies and we get to see Stan Lee for the last time.",NA
Venom,"Boring, Cheesy, Bad Effects",Marcus,14-Dec-18,,1,Man this movie was boorrrrriiiiinnngggg and very forced. Effects looked like they were from a 90s movie. Just bad all the way around.,1

Venom,This is a must see!,OCWOMAN,11-Jan-19,,5,"I watched this on a whim and was glad I did! Taken on its own, this is as good as any of the Marvel series. Tom Hardy was marvelous in the lead and Michelle Williams turns in an award-winning performance.*POSSIBLE SPOILER* Continue watching throughout the credits!",NA
Venom,Very disappointed with venom.,Lifelesslump,27-Jan-19,,1,"This movie was a huge let down. Every joke fell flat, the characters all were easily forgettable. And I feel Tom Hardy didn't even try. I am a big fan of venom in games, comics, ect. just not movies. I feel spiderman 3 was better than this. and that is saying something.",NA
Venom,A FUN Watch,Kri Kri,13-Jan-19,,5,"Just fun to watch. Has a high, yet dark, amusement factor. Surprisingly clean gore wise considering the fact Venom eats some people.

Venom,I really enjoyed this movie,Yurdle,22-Dec-18,,5,"I read Venom comics when I was young and enjoyed the character then, this movie was really well done and really enjoyable. Tom Hardy gave the character a little depth, as a creepy alien who has great banter, he was a great counterpoint he is such a real Eddie Brock, super fun movie, can't wait for the Venom and Spidey crossover.",NA
Venom,A predictable anti-hero movie ...,Alice,12-Jan-19,,3,"Venom is a predictable anti-hero movie. I'm glad that I didn't go see it in the theaters because the dialog, action scenes, and overall plot runs a bit too comic-book for my taste. Still, it wasn't a terrible movie. Definitely worth renting if you're into anti-hero movies.",NA
Venom,Pleasantly surprised.,Randy81,29-Dec-18,,4,"I liked it, it was a high quality comic book movie. I've always been a fan of Venom and I was skeptical about them going a whole different direction with the origin, but the movie was great.I'm looking forward to hopefully more Venom movies.",NA
Venom,Really enjoyed this,e40,6-Jan-19,,5,"Given the reviews I saw, I was skeptical.  Sometimes low expectations help, but this was truly a good movie.  Yeah, it took 40 minutes to get to the action, but that's because there was a story that needed it.  Definitely worth the 6 bucks.",NA
Venom,Great movie!!! Want more!!!,jbinchrist,25-Dec-18,,5,Great movie! Tom Hardy is a great actor and the cgi is spot on in this adaptation. The only issue I seen was that the case claims the movie is 1 hr and 52 minutes when it is really around 1 hr 34 minutes. Doesn't affect the movie in any way but just made me want to see more haha. Can't wait for a next part.,NA
Venom,Horrible,Knut 2650,5-Feb-19,,1,"Looks like Disney is well on their was to ruining another franchise.  Terrible storyline, awful acting, lefty politics.If Venom can repair broken bones and fatal injuries,  then fix Eddy's horrible teeth.  Looks like a junky.",NA
Venom,I won't be seeing this one.,KF,30-Dec-18,,5,"It's too bad. It looks like it might be good. I won't see it because I don't like Democrats, (which Ruben Fleischer is) the Hollyweird they have manufactured, or the way they seem to think I voted for them. Well, I'm voting now. Go away.",NA
Venom,Just could not justify watching any more of this,townie52,5-Jan-19,,1,"What did I like?  Costumes and make-up?  What didn't I like?  Storyline, acting, dialog",1
Venom,it's gets worse as it progresses,Kindle Customer,18-Dec-18,,2,as this movie moved along it became clear it was lazy and simply silly.  Tom Hardy is a great actor but his portrayal/interpretation of this character is irritating.  It's the end of the world yet everyone is casual. I was frustrated.,NA
Venom,Bonus Content is a joke.,RobertPatrascu,25-Feb-19,,4,"It would help you look less stupid if you put the main actor Tom Hardy on the list of people starring in this movie. Just saying.Overall enjoyed the movie and rating it as such, I like the idea of Venom as an anti-hero.The Bonus content was a ripoff even with the added footage movie is about an hour and 30 minute runtime.",NA

Venom,Duality at its finest!,CRF Christine,19-Dec-18,,5,"Completely loved this. Tom Hardy was masterful with the writers providing just the right amount of dark and light humor to his character. Split personality never looked so good or ugly. Of all the recent Marvel adventures, this one absolutely nails it!",NA
Venom,Save your money.,Amazon Customer,24-Dec-18,,1,"Maybe it is just me but I hope that my standards in movies are a little higher than what I received with this movie.  It is just another alien dominated movie that does not hold your interest.  It attempts to slide in some humor here and there but fails terribly.  Same story as in most alien movies...... Alien sneaks in, inhabits someone and creates chaos.  Over it!",1
Venom,Whole lotta fun,David,17-Feb-19,,5,"Tom Hardy can't go wrong.  Looks like he had a ton of fun with the character and the role.  Curious to see if this will ultimately get tied into the MCU or if it will wind up a stand alone film.  Wasn't a whole lot of tie ins to Spider-Man at all and that was kind of disappointing but if you can forget for a couple hours everything you remember about Venom as a kid, you can just sit back and enjoy the ride!",NA
Venom,it's okay,Queen Ama,25-Dec-18,,4,"Another cartoon movie. I agree with one customer that said it doesn't have format. Good movie for kids though. Good editing, good cinema, good continuity but the format is weak. I will recommend it for entertainment for kids.",NA

Venom,i wasn't expecting much but I actually liked it,Amazon Customer,20-Dec-18,,5,"It was more of a movie like Deadpool than a Disney Marvel movie.

Venom,Not a superhero movie where he fights the bad guys & doesn't kill no one.,John Balducci,21-Dec-18,,4,"Tom Hardy does it again , takes a villain and turns him into a likeable funny villain like Bane.

Venom,"Fantastic acting, humor, and action",Seay Polhemus,14-Dec-18,,5,I did not read comics as a kid so I can't speak to the adherence of the characters to them. I found the movie very entertaining and loved the duality of the main character. Tom Hardy makes Venom a great anti-hero and gives an amazing performance. The stunts and special effects were bad ass and the action scenes with Venom's autonomous defenses and attacks were perfect. The plot with the villain seemed rushed and somewhat weak but I still found myself enjoying the movie...definitely worth a watch!,NA
Venom,Good not great still loved it. Screw critics,Jesse,29-Dec-18,,5,Not a solid 5 star but i would still say a 4.6. Venom looks awesome. He sounds awesome. Eddie and venom are awesome. What wasnt awesome was the story plot. It was easy and predictable and the movie could have gone in more depth to explain how they got the specimens.Id like to see a second or even a TV serises. Since i was a kid venom was my favorite marvel character. Was it worth a watch 100 percent!!!,NA

Venom,Exceeds expectations,Laura Ragsdale,19-Dec-18,,5,Tom Hardy is amazing and more than makes up for the train wreck that was the Topher Grace venom.,1
Venom,Awesome Movie,lyricaldemise,22-Dec-18,,5,"The special affects are incredible. There's no nudity or sex scenes. There's violence but no gore. Overall, a spectacular movie.",NA
Venom,Not bad,The Douglass Family,28-Dec-18,,3,For the most part it was entertaining but it was much shorter than expected. I think it was about an hour and twenty minutes.,NA
Venom,Don't waste your money.,Greg Chastain,22-Dec-18,,1,"Complete waste of time, real bad story line and poorly acted, missed the mark completely. Better luck next time. Try reading a few comic's books before you start the sequel!",NA
Venom,The Critics of this Movie are completely Stupid,Amazon Customer,7-Jan-19,,5,I know Sony could not mention anything about Spiderman because of legal reasons. But that is what I liked best. To completely retcon Venom to just being an Alien movie is brilliant. I hated the whole Spiderman crap. I loathed the wierd direction from the comics post secret wars. I say kudos. Please never mention Spiderman and venom in the same movie again. Brilliant stand alone movie. No Comic reading required.,NA
Venom,Venom,LAMAR,16-Dec-18,,5,I it at the movies and it was GREAT! Can't wait for the blu-ray! But do anyone know what the digital copy is on? Itunes or vudu?,NA
Venom,What a fun flick,Laurens Hamilton,17-Oct-18,,5,"I don't remember the last time I diverged so much from movie critics.While Tom Hardy's performances as Eddie Brock and Venom are the biggest draw, I thought the whole thing was scripted pretty deftly.

Venom,Not impressed,2js Studio,12-Dec-18,,1,Waste of time,1
Venom,"Good effects, bad character development.",Mark Rogers,18-Dec-18,,2,"[Spoilers ahead!]Decent set up for the movie, along with a lovely sociopath for a villain.  Down on his luck protagonist meets our paired protagonist and weird things happen - normal for a superhero movie.  Some characterization for Venom, which is promptly thrown out the window for the third act.Most abrupt face-heel-turn I've ever seen, and probably the most disappointing.",NA
Venom,Give it a watch.,David Ty Libert,12-Dec-18,,5,Awesome movie from start to end. Despite people's rants an cries over plot holes etc. This is a good direction for venom fans who don't like spicy like me.,NA
Venom,HILARIOUS AND FUN! BEST ANTI HERO MOVIE I'VE SEEN!,Jeepgirl173,23-Dec-18,,5,I expected this to be a very serious bad guy movie with a predictable plot and stupid cracks like Deadpool.

Venom,So much fun!,C3,23-Feb-19,,5,This movie is one of my all time favorite superhero movies. It actually does something unique with the genre and is so much fun to watch.

Venom,Tom Hardy is Great,Dave Hammond,22-Dec-18,,5,"I wasn't sure I would get through this as I am a bit down on horror genre, which I thought this would be. So Wrong.Tom Hardy is a great actor and very good as  our anti hero Eddie Brock. With one liners added from the Venom CG character  this movie was a surprising 5 star comic adventure . I hope there will be more of this duo in our future.",NA
Venom,watch out for cursing (f-bomb),E. Cullen,14-Jan-19,,4,"Movies was really good. Something different for a change. However, quite a bit of cursing for a PG-13 movie. Including f- bomb and p word. Was not expecting that.",NA

The interactions between Eddie and Venom had me laughing the whole time. I know the critics were hard on this movie, but I hope to see another one made sometime. It was bittersweet to see Stan Lee's cameo though.",NA
Venom,It is a good origin movie,Logan,29-Dec-18,,5,"I regret not seeing this in theaters. I trusted the reviews and they were wrong. It is an awesome origin story movie.

I got on cycle and just enjoyed the ride and was sad when the ride was over. The commentary on how we view people was awesome!  It actually had more social and personal insights than I think people give the movie credit for. Watch it and then reflect on the Venom inside of you.,NA
Venom,You can never escape politics,Amazon Customer,7-Jan-19,,1,Typical leftist mind prison propaganda embedded in a multimillion dollar hollywood production.

Venom,"A mediocre film only made for money, but not terrible.",Alejandro M Pantoja,21-Jan-19,,3,"The movie is a bit underwhelming, but I still enjoy watching it. I only wished that Sony waited for Marvel Studios to put Venom in the MCU, but overall not a terrible film, but also not a good one.",NA

Venom,"Another SONY ""Hit""",Irish,7-Oct-18,,1,"This movie is both boring as sin, and hilariously bad. The first act drags on and on... the 2nd act feels incomplete and the 3rd act is entertainingly terrible.This movie tries to be edgey and dark, but like an emo teenager when you look back at it it's just embarrassing.I love Tom Hardy (and he is by far the best part of the film) but his acting is awful here and his voice is odd and a little hard to understand.The villians are cookie cutter 1 demensional characters who exist because it's a comic book film, and there has to be a villian...Also the effects look awful, esspecially in the 3rd act, it's as if Venom was supposed to be released 15 years ago. That's how dated it feels.",3

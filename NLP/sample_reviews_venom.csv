"1","Venom","Large amounts of fun","MacJunegrand","October 24, 2018","Format: Prime Video",5,"Movie critics have a though job, I get it. They have to watch lots of movies and not for pleasure, but as a job. They can't just relax and have fun, they need to sit down and analyze every bit of a movie: script, acting, effects, lighting, music, dialogue, etc. They also have to compare with films of different genres and with the actors and directors previous efforts. There's a lot of work and baggage, and it's understandable when they demand more from a film. On the other hand, this process means they simply don't see films the way the general public does, and this disconnect sometimes means they'll be harsher on a film than they need to be. Sometimes this will be out of handling different expectations, and sometimes, being human as they still are, it'll be out of pure unfairness.In the case of Venom, it seems to be a combination of both. The film seems to be almost universally reviled by critics while almost universally loved by audiences. While being completely fair I'll admit many of the complaints about this movie are completely legitimate, I still believe the treatment is receiving by critics is still preposterously exaggerated. I've ranted about this before, but it seems critics have simply grown accustomed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's formula, and anything that strays from it in any direction is automatically judged harsher, whether it deserves it or not. And Venom absolutely doesn't. Yes, it's campy. Yes, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Yes, it doesn't have any messages and it doesn't deal with any current socio-political issues. What does Venom offer in place of all that? Simple, primal and unbridled FUN.Venom is the story of Eddie Brock, a reporter who believes in doing the right thing, even by using unconventional methods, and even if it means telling the truth about powerful people. Is because of this that he decides to investigate on a rich industrialist who's secretly kidnapping people and experimenting on them. This gets him in serious trouble, and having no good deed going unpunished, he loses his job, girlfriend and apartment. But when a scientist grows a conscience and tells Brock about the secret experiments the industrialist is doing by merging humans with parasitical sentient goo life form known as ""symbiotes"", he decides to pay a visit and inadvertently becomes host for one of these creatures. Hilarity ensues.The symbiote merging with Eddie calls himself ""Venom"". It's an intelligent creature that needs to feed and has less scruples about killing than Eddie does. With Eddie they form a symbiosis: the alien will augment Eddie's strength, agility and resilience while Eddie provides the alien with sustenance until he can find his companions. Having no choice, since he's being followed by people who want him dead, Eddie complies, but now finds himself bond to a creature that could cause the deaths of millions. Meanwhile, another symbiote named ""Riot"" is traveling the planet in search for the rest, and he has even less respect for other forms of life. Will Eddie be able to control Venom or convince him to join his side or will Venom and Riot unite against humanity?Here's why Venom resonates so much with audiences: the story is simple to follow, the main characters are likable and, unlike other films in recent years, it doesn't try to beat messages into the audience's heads. Expect no attempts at political agendas or social issues; every bit of dialogue is in service of the story or the characters. But the main reason is that both main characters are just really fun to watch. Eddie and Venom form basically a buddy cop movie, with two different personalities clashing and being forced to work together.They're also bloody hilarious. I complain a lot about movies in the MCU using humor as an excuse for plot development, having every character being a snide wise-cracker and ruining legitimately tense moments for the sake of a joke, but this one doesn't fall into those pits. The humor is relegated to Eddie and Venom's relationship, so not all characters feel the same, and tense moments are not punctuated by jokes, so the tension isn't lost.Yes, I'll say that there are a bunch of plot holes and perhaps the story is too overly simplistic for those who expect something more, but if you're willing to just relax and have fun, this movie does the job very well.How does it work as an adaptation? People complained a lot about the movie not being R-Rated and Spider-Man not forming part of the origin story, an I say that those people simply have no idea what they're talking about. Venom has always been goofy in the comics, this isn't a new development, and Spider-Man's involvement is unnecessary, since the character is strong enough to thrive on its own. Yes, having Venom show up in a Spider-Man movie would be benefitial... for Spider-Man's character. But Venom can perfectly work on its own without Spidey. That being said, I would very much like to see the characters clash in the future. We'll have to see, since it's still not clear if Venom and Spider-Man even exist in the same universe yet.Bottom-line: if you're expecting elaborate plots, social messages and/or a serious tone this is the wrong place. But if all you want is fun, Venom will do the job perfectly.",392
"2","Venom","Nobody channels Eddie Brock / Venom like Tom Hardy. Nobody!","kiwijinxter","October 12, 2018","Format: Blu-ray",5,"As someone who had hundreds of Spider-Man comics when I was younger (I even owned a copy of Amazing Spider-Man #300 featuring the first full appearance of Venom), this is the PERFECT Venom origin story. And when I see Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, Venom's alter ego, it makes me feel happy, contented and as fuzzy as the symbiote.In the comics, Eddie Brock is a character that is a bit of an outcast, is unsure of himself and gets even more confused (initially) when Venom entered his life, and Tom Hardy channels Eddie Brock to perfection!!! Venom in the comics had some dark-ish humour, and the humour that Venom spouts in the movie is spot on - in fact Venom gets the best one liners. And the biggest laughs from the audience. The movie portrays a beautiful symbiotic relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom, and shows progression in their relationship throughout the movie.The CGI for Venom is also spot on, making him a highly flexible and versatile character with the symbiotic extensions doing some cool stunts. It makes Venom look cool and dangerous at the same time. The pacing is just right, and Tom Hardy's versatility as an actor really stole the show, so much so that this would work even if this was a one man show.And the post-credit sneak preview is ""one to die for"" - I DEFINITELY want to see the next Venom - it'll be CGI carnage...Peeps, forget the previous incarnation of Venom, this is the REAL deal. Possibly the best movie I've seen in 2018 to date. Stuff the stuffy professional critics. They haven't had any clue for the past 25 years and are no longer credible sources for good movies - much like the fake news. Go watch Venom. It's da bomb!",80
"3","Venom","What a stinker - easily the wost movie I have ever rented on Amazon and I deeply regret it.","Charles Schoch","December 20, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",1,"This movie was bad. How bad?  It is the only rental I have memory of where I deeply regret spending the 6 bucks and wish I could take it back.Let's get going with the review.  Let's pretend you went to see a new release of ""Hamlet""  starring a current big name star ...  in fact. Let's go back in time.  Remember when Mel Gibson put out hat new  Hamlet back ... 20 years ago?  Let's pretend that happened.  Only when you went to see Hamlet, Hamlet is not the Prince of Denmark, he's actually Chinese and the movie takes place in 1971 and he is an Astronaut.  You would go ""What the hel is going on here?""  right?  That is the Venom movie.  I'm a *huge* fan of Tom Hardy, but the character isn't Eddie Brock and this isn't Venom.Venom is a bad guy.  Not a ""anti-hero""  not a  ambiguous character that sometimes helps and sometimes does not.  He is a very very bad person.  Eddie Brock is a bad person, the symbiote is a bad space critter - that is one of the reasons they team up against Spider-Man.There is an established  fiction associate with the character.  They didn't make him up, he's been around for 20 years  in stories, which is what  spurred my ""Hamlet"" comparison.  All they seem to have done is buy the like-ness of the character and then kind of went ""Meh"" and just invented a complete new everything for it.The ""complete new everything"" isn't even that great.  Eddie isn't a villain, he's a hero! A reporter every-man who gets smacked down by the corporate ""man"" and his career ruined for seeking the ""truth!""  It's so freaking tired and cliche.  Again - this ain't Hamlet but ... come on.... at least put some effort in.  This smacks of ""we had to make a movie or lose the rights"" to me. A low effort  legal compliance shlock film.The space symbiote is just some self-described ""loser"" from space that likes earth because he isn't such a loser by comparison.  He's like a ...loser superman without the moral framework.  So that sucks and is just bad. It's all so bad.The special effects!  These are pretty bad too, the part's where Mr. Hardy has the symbiote kind of .... composited onto bits of him, like half his face or an arm aren't awful.... there's some serious color issues, but they look ok, the entire effect falls apart when he is full on Venom, which looks terrible.  Whoever did that CG should just hang their head in shame - he looks ridiculous. A man in a rubber suit would look better.The Villian is ... the Indian love-child of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.  ....I'm completely serious.  It is as absolutely stupid as it sounds.There is a love interest for reasons.... she is basically Pepper Potts from IronMan 3.  Yeah, the bad Iron Man where Pepper gets in a suit. coughHINTcough.Basically this movie is a rodeo of failure that smacks of the studio tossing it out the door with the minimum effort given.  Mr. Hardy does his best, but frankly he hasn't got much to work with.  There was once or twice when the dialog between Brock and the Symbiote made me smirk a little,  but largely it falls flat.Final Thought - Don't go see it. It sounds like it's so bad it is good from this - it isn't.  The movie largely takes itself very seriously (with a very small handful of exceptions)  it is a waste of time, save your money.",38
"4","Venom","Excellent!","H. Tague","December 11, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",5,"Been a huge fan of Venom since the 90s and been waiting for a good live action adaptation of him ever since and it's about time! This film doesn't hold back, it hits fast and hard with top notch action and effects, capturing all the visceral and chaotic energy of the comic book character. Venom is a standout among antiheroes, part lovecraftian nightmare abomination and part twisted mad genius of Todd McFarlane and all awesome!Don't let the critics fool you. They don't like comic characters to start with and their minds are blown and burnt on the runaway success of MCU. This is some of Marvel's best material free of social commentary reveling in it's own excellence!",29
"5","Venom","Not Good","Reginald Thornburton","December 21, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",1,"As a fan of Marvel and Tom Hardy, I wanted to like this.  It was just so formulaic and juvenile.  Basically the antithesis of Infinity Wars, which was stellar.  I wasn't expecting this to be the Schindler's List of comic book films but come on, it feels like a group of 10 year olds collaborated to write this piece of crap.  I'm guessing the money it made at the box office is indicative of how much people like the character of Venom and were willing to roll the dice on a poorly reviewed film (as was I) because I highly doubt it was from repeat viewings.  This movie is so bad it's ""recent DC films"" bad.",23
"6","Venom","Missing the mark here","JC","December 19, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",1,"Wow was i diissapointed it expected it be way better than it was. First hour was boring so you see action at ending and still it’s wasn’t all that exciting.  Thought the reviews would have been more negative.  Just wanted to see more of Venom.  Nothing about the visual effects was impressive to me atol. Overall a movie that could have been great but was simply a big letdown.",16
"7","Venom","overall bad movie/Marvel and Disney failed","Clayton","December 18, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",1,"This is the first movie in which Tom Hardy acted that I did not like.  This movie was terrible.  The plot was weak.  Venom suddenly wants to save Earth because he likes it and because he likes his host.  The acting was bad on all parts.  They tried to make this movie humorous and failed.  This was just a failure of a movie.  Don't pay to watch this movie.",16
"8","Venom","Wait until 4.99 and rent","Chris Avolt","December 11, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",1,"Watch the trailer and that is the movie.",17
"9","Venom","I Can't Wait For More Sequels","Rich Whitcomb","December 22, 2018","Verified Purchase",5,"Venom is an awesome movie that everyone should add to their Marvel collection.  Tom Hardy makes a much better Eddie Brock than Topher Grace. The one thing that did bother me about Tom Hardy, is that, he reminded me of Nick (Jake Johnson) from that show New Girl.  He seemed to have almost the exact same quarks, antics, and almost talk the same way too.  The picture, sound, special effects, and CGI are absolutely amazing in this movie!  I also think 4k is spoiling me.  Whenever I used to watch movies on DVD and Blu-ray, the dark scenes were always horrible to watch because you could barely see what was going on, but with 4k, the dark scenes are almost perfect when you watch them and you don't have to strain your eyes to figure out what's going on.  I highly recommend this movie to everybody!  I looked at Tom Hardy's profile to see when the next one would be coming out and there isn't any listed yet, but I read he signed on to do several sequels.  I hope everybody enjoys this movie as much as I did.",11
"10","Venom","Don't get carried away with accuracy","Alex","December 15, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",5,"I don't have an in depth grasp of the marvel character, so I can't comment on the accuracy of the translation. As a stand alone movie, I think it's fabulous. I like anti-heroes, Spawn has the on the edge stuff too, but Venom does it best. I like that they have the confidence to set up a franchise in the first movie. Usually pioneering movies end in a completed way. If the movie is a success they open a franchise. Here, we get Eddie and Venom in a relatively cooperative state going to meet Carnage.There will always be backlash from fundamentalist fans, but it shouldn't stand in the way of possibility.",10
"11","Venom","Paid reviews aside, a critical look at ""Venom.""","Vargr","December 13, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",3,"So, ""Venom,"" where do I start? The good? The bad? The ugly (CGI)?How about instead of a structured thesis-style presentation I just stream of conscious my impressions of the movie?The VERY beginning of Venom is actually pretty bland, it's not unlike the beginning of Rampage, ""space, specimens, oh jeez a wreck."" After this segment, Venom actually does a pretty good job at being a low-impact horror-esque film for a little bit. We see a symbiont jumping from one person to the next, levying horror and murder everywhere it goes. I was pretty engaged, thinking to myself ""this is pretty edgy for a marvel film."" Now, the horror elements are neutered, to the point it kind of reminds me of the ""sweat instead of blood"" SNES Mortal Kombat port of old. You will see some people die, a few get eaten, but you won't ""see"" it if you know what I mean?We're then turned to Eddie Brock and given a glimpse into what a narcissistic loser he is for about 20 minutes. You're also treated to the sociopathic ""genius"" head of the facility that owns the spacecraft you saw in the beginning. Somewhere in this mixture you finally get to see the symbiont that will become Venom jump to Brock. I'm going to take a second here to voice my irritation with how simple they make the bonding process look. In the comics, as Venom evolved, the process of the organism bonding with hosts became much more violent. This aspect of the character should have been maintained in this movie, in my opinion. It would feel much more visceral if you saw images of these ""symbiotes"" somewhat violently forcing themselves on their hosts than the ""oh I've spilled some grape juice on my shirt aaaaaaand it's gone"" kind of effect they went with.For the sake of this review I'll separate Venom into three acts, Eddie merging with the symbiont marks the end of act one. At this point in the movie, there is an abrupt change in tone. It goes from this tame horror style that it established, to a comedy. It's not a smooth transition either, Eddie is walking down the street after escaping the lab, a gravelly voice starts talking to him. There is little time spent studying the bonding process between symbiont and man, there is little time spent showing the symbiont digging into who Eddie is as a person, and there is little time spent explaining or even really discussing the physiological symptoms they describe as byproducts of the union between man and alien. They actually never address this to a point I am comfortable with. In the scene where a doctor describes to Eddie that the symbiont is harming him, potentially even dooming him, they never make a point of explaining how the symbiont is in fact a ""symbiote"" and not a ""parasite"" by definition. At the end of act 2, the movie again abruptly changes pace by ending this comedic stretch it establishes and turning somewhat dark again, as Venom explains that under no uncertain circumstances, it's goal is domination and eradication of the human species, and then earth. Venom even taunts Brock at one point, ""You’re a loser.""The movie lost my attention somewhat around this point, so I may have missed something in the third act, which is where the stereotypical ""redemption and boss battle"" sequence plays in. This is where I really developed some gripes with the CGI, it's pretty lackluster in the beginning, the big ""Venom reveal"" was undercut by just how bad Venom looks, in my opinion at least, maybe you'll be easier on the visuals. Actually, ""bad"" may be a poor choice of word, ""cheap"" is a more accurate term in my mind. He looks ""shiny"" and unrefined, it reminds of 10 year old almost top of the line CGI. The visuals are really unimpressive.From here, we follow Eddie and Venom as become fast friends and eventually fight the other symbiont that's been roaming freely since the beginning of the movie. The final showdown feels like it was meant to be really epic, yet it didn't even keep my eyes on the screen. I actually started playing FFT WOTL on my phone when Eddie made a statement something to the effect of ""I had an alien in my @$$."" The movie eventually ends with a pretty stereotypical death for the main antagonist, and you're then thrust onto Eddie's shoulder as he walks into a prison to interview a serial killer. I did smile when I saw Woody Harrelson's face, that smile turned a furrowed frown with the closing line of the film... ""When I get out of here, and I will... There WILL be... CARNAGE.""I heard Stan and Kyle from Southpark in the back of my head... ""Oh f*** you.""In the end, I'm left with this as an impression... Venom could have been a really good movie. I do understand they /have/ to tie him into the larger Marvel Comics Cinematic Universe at some point, so I get that they needed to present a product tame enough for a wide audience, from their perspectives at least. However, in my opinion, which is worth what it cost you... They could have simply done Venom right as a stand-alone movie, included all the necessary horror and violence elements in full swing, while providing a final act that ran a compelling change of heart on Venom's side, and really still been perfectly set to have him appear in more kid friendly films without much adjustment.So while Venom isn't really a ""bad movie,"" it's a really average film with a great leading man, if it wasn't for Tom Hardy's general affability, the film would have had zero charisma (which was a better movie). I just didn't really find the movie ""likeable,"" I'll watch it again over the weekend with my wife and a few beers, maybe that will improve the experience, but I doubt it.",7
"12","Venom","The Death of Superhero Films","T. Norton","December 15, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",1,"The film doesn’t know what it really wants to be and the CGI is terribly dodgy. Felt like I was watching a SyFy movie.",11
"13","Venom","Too bad this had to be Stan Lee’s Last Movie","Christopher Hausmann","December 22, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",1,"Lame!  My teenagers liked it but that was about it.  The main star subtraction is for Amazon not the movie!!!I just wish that Amazine would let me custom arrange my Video Library instead of only offering by date purchased or alphabetical order.  I would prefer to arrange by genre, episode, number in franchise so that I could group my movies together instead of having a hodge podge to sort through!",9
"14","Venom","Critics say meh, but they'd be wrong","Sam Kreutzer","December 15, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",5,"Rotten Tomatoes gives Venom a 28%, IMDb a 6.9/10 and Metacritic a 35% but I strongly disagree. Tom Hardy is excellent as Eddie Brock and Venom. I'd been wanting to see this movie for a while and lemme tell you, 10/10 would recommend. Venom is hilarious and it makes me think about these 'symbiotes' and their consciousness, where they're not so far off from humans. If you're on the edge about this movie, I think it's great! Dark humor, a plot that's pretty easy to follow and who can go wrong with Tom Hardy?",10
"15","Venom","Rushed, Uninspired, Embarrassing, Poorly cast, at least its short.","Max Lennon Keith","December 21, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",1,"This movie is the worst kind of bad movie. A mediocre bad movie. Nothing outstanding here. Undeveloped characters with little to no motivation at all, poor set up, no reason to care. Some fun little action moments here and there and comedy that often falls flat. Cheap looking cgi, Venom looks silly. No reason to watch this movie unless you're a Venom fan I guess.",10
"16","Venom","The professional critics are but holes. Venom to me surprisingly, OUTSTANDING!!!!!","Mark Schuster","December 24, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",5,"I DIDN'T DISLIKE ANYTHING!  The initial trailer did the opposite most trailers do. It left me totally uninterested. I normally buy Marvel comic movies. I never read a Venom comic. I will now. The relationship with eddie (incredible actor) and Venom is OUTSTANDING! Ive watched it 5 times for each start i've given it. I rented it thinking it would be so so from the trailer. trust me its not so so. It is the most FUN movie i've seen in a long time. I loved avengers infinity war. I loved Ragnarok. But I loved Venom the most. There is no part I fast forwarded through even on the 5th watch !BUY IT! totally outstanding.This is the first Tom Hardy movie i've ever seen. What a power house. incredible dry humor.  His conversations with Venom are hysterical! I mean if I were falling off a building screaming I could never think of ""Where did you go...where did you go ahhhhh stop. I got us lol each scene is just incredibleBy the elevators Venom says  JUMP as they are like 200 stories in the air. Next scene Tom hardy (eddie) is pushing the elevator button.Venom says in his venom voice ""Pussy"" you gotta be there ! incredible ! Im not much for the academy awards but id give both Edie and venom an academy award!  ""Another great line ""No you do not eat policemen"" lol Its not frightening, but then none of the Marvel movies are frightening.  Its just super entertaining. And Im not one to ever much do a review unless I absolutely love it.I wonder who played Venom. his voice and the things he said the way he said them incredible!",5

Mind blown. Love the story, the concept, the detailed flow of the outline, the interesting context and the incredible special effects are TOP NOTCH!  The humor is delightful, darkly delightful, I don't know who does the voice of Venom, but the delivery is perfection. This is a watch over and over again movie. So glad it finally became available, this was one I was salivating for! And I was not disappointed. 10 stars!!!!",6
"19","Venom","Loved it!","SHAWN KERMANI","December 11, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",5,"I am sorry but the critics don't know what they are talking about. This is a great Venom based movie. Tom Hardy does a excellent job playing both Eddie Broc, and Venom. The critics all cried foul over one issue most of all, and that was , ""Where is Spiderman?"", WHO CARES if Spiderman is not in the movie, I came to see Venom. ""But you can't have Venom without Spiderman."" Yum, yes you can!Anyway, long story short Venom is both dark, funny, and sappy at times. Could it have been more violent if it had an R rating? Sure, but nonetheless it is worth your money and time if you are a fan of Venom.",6
"20","Venom","Just not good","E. Ostrom","December 16, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",1,"Maybe if your a Tom Hardy fan you can look past this mess of a movie.  It takes forever before before Venom shows up. The story is long and boring.",8
"21","Venom","VERY Misleading Runtime","MovieMan M","January 8, 2019","Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase",3,"The movie itself is alright, it's just that it's actually only 90 minutes long with 17 minutes of end credits, a two minute mid-credit scene, and a four minute post credit clip from the upcoming spider-verse movie. This is even more frustrating because the first actual Venom transformation isn't until the 1 hour mark, so the movie is basically an hour of build-up and then 30 minutes of action.",6
"22","Venom","Better than Spider-Man 3","James Wink","December 26, 2018","Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase",3,"Watching Venom, I was pleasantly surprised -  I was better than it had any right to be after a series of disappointing trailers and bad critical reviews. There are many reasons why this movie is not very good - the plot is laughable, the CG goes from pretty decent to horrible. For Marvel-fans, it pretty much destroys any continuity from the comic books. With these negatives, the review should be 1 - 2 stars but I am giving Venom three stars for one reason: Tom Hardy. His presence anchors Venom in a way that makes all the criticism fall away. His performance is the best thing about the movie and elevates it into a respectable movie. He makes you sympathetic to Eddie Brock, an anti-hero with very few redeemable qualities. What helps elevate his performance is that Eddie doesn't really become a hero....he is still on the line between hero and villain at the end of the movie (I will leave it up to fellow viewers to determine which side of the line).Venom is still not a good movie but it is far from the debacle that everyone suspected before its release. I am cautiously optimistic about the inevitable sequel.Mild Recommend.",3
"23","Venom","Ignore the critic and watch this movie!","Linda J.","December 16, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",5,"I heard so many bad things about this movie that I waited for video to watch it.  I'm sad that I did.  It was AWESOME!!!  Tom Hardy did an excellent job with both characters.  It was entertaining and funny.  I'm glad I bought it so I can watch it again and again.",6
"24","Venom","Partner up with your own Symbiont.","fenx1200","December 21, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",5,"I thought the beginning of the movie was a bit cheesy as well as the acting.  Perhaps a low budget movie was going to unfold before my eyes with really one good actor, and that is Tom Hardy, and even his acting was a bit troubling.  However, as the plot unfolded, the action and the acting picked up quickly leading to a movie in which I had to stay tuned to every minute, lest I would miss something vital to the overall performance.  The movie quickly grew on me and I found myself embracing the alien, Venom. and his partner, Tom Hardy, as both of them teamed up to destroy evil for the greater good of the earth. I won't spoil the plot, and keep in mind that this is a Marvel Universe film, not an epic masterpiece like Gone With The Wind, but perhaps just as important when it comes to saving the Earth from an Alien Invasion.  If you love Marvel movies, then you will enjoy this one, and perhaps you'll want to get your own symbiont, and fight crime to feed the beast.",3
"25","Venom","A Very Hardy Movie","K. Borah","January 18, 2019","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",4,"The story suffers from what I now call Stan Lee Syndrome or Origins disease. Seems Marvel can't write a script without bogging it down with origins and this plight as infected several other media presentations of late... Think about the excessive flash backing in almost every TV show or spending needless story time making sure we know way more then we need to know about why someone is the way they are. Be that has it may, this film survives, not by it's creative storytelling by any stretch of the imagination or lack there of but by it's strong casting. Mainly Tom Hardy, the titular character who is able to bring a refreshing grounded quality in portraying his plight to understand and comprehend the strange things that are happening to him. Michelle Williams is a bright star who deserves more screen time then she is given here. By the time the credits role you are left wondering why they did not let us know more about her then we were allowed to enjoy. Overall, seeing this film on its first viewing prompted me to see it again (something few films have accomplished since LOTR) says a great deal about it's watch-ability. Die hard fans seem to complain that the Venom character is toned down too much from its comic book persona and I can understand why this would be an issue. It seems this would have been better served has a Hard R action fest then a over produced Saturday matinee extravaganza that it has become, but it still manages to entertain just for performances if not the story or the lack thereof.",2
"26","Venom","A fun movie, of a comic character world. I hope they do more with Tom Hardy!","jason guion","December 23, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",4,"Before watching it I saw a review on YouTube savaging this movie. The guy made a high production value and very long video decrying so called dual prologues, confusing time jumps...but I rented anyway. I really enjoyed it, and I feel sorry for anyone who was unable to go into a movie understanding it comes from a comic book, and wasn’t supposed to touch nerves the way Saving Private Ryan does. Tom Hardy is a great actor of our time in my opinion. Roles like his homeless Stuart, as scary London gangsters, all the way to roles as a good guy with a sweet disposition are all great to watch, and he does a great job here of being kind but tough good man with a broken heart trying to do good, while doing an excellent job having to pretend that there is a whole other living personality inside him deciding to move in permanently, knowing everything it’s host knows and feels. The review said the effects were average, but they were as good as any, and the story is fast, and funny with great thought out action sequences. Who doesn’t love Steve Mcqueen inventing the car chase, and then doesn’t enjoy a kick butt chase here as well. Everyone did a great job acting, and the there are only really one time jump, and it is simply forward. If that is confusing, or you came for some never before seen special effects as your motivation instead of the Venom comic world and story in it then go see something else.

But nope, it was just riot vs venom. The others were no where to be found towards the end of the movie. It does however make you think though as to what happens to the others, maybe one of them is carnage looking for a new host (Cletus)??? Who knows??? All I know is that this movie is still a fun ride. The action was awesome and Venom looked very cool. The cg of venom was kind of bad at times, and yet other times it looked good which was weird. It felt like some scenes the cgi was done differently by different people, which explains why at times Venom looks great and then a little fake the next shot. Overall, the movie was a fun ride and I'm sure the budget for the next film will allow for a better cg venom. All I know is I'm ready for some Carnage. Can't wait for Venom 2!!!! I highly suggest this movie.",2
"29","Venom","Uneven and full of plotholes, but fun","mcteenie","December 19, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",3,"The odd part of this movie is that I feel like despite the first third of it grinding on forever setting up Eddie Brock and his foes that the plot and characters are 2 dimensional and cliche.  Near the end, everyone's motivations seemingly come out of nowhere (and don't benefit from all the meandering plot building in the establishing act) and there's zero reason you'd imagine anyone to be doing whatever they're doing.  If cut and paced better, maybe this wouldn't annoy me so much and the film would warrant more than one viewing.  Others have pointed out that it does feel like a throwback to 90s superhero/action films (for better or worse) and I'll definitely agree with that.I think all the actors (who are otherwise phenomenal) are wasted in this.  Tom Hardy meanders through like an unlikeable drunk which may have been the point.  The cast is great, but they presumably did their best with the script they were given.Overall, I had fun watching this.  Venom (the character) was great and when things finally started happening it was a fun ride.  Venom interacting with Eddie came off as hokey at first, but was pretty funny once I stopped framing the movie in my head as a ""serious"" super hero movie.I'm confused as to why Sony made this film; now that Spider Man is in the other Marvel universe and was very conspicuously absent , it leaves out a big part of Venom's story and origin.  Even in the unlikely event that Venom made the jump to that universe, he's coming over more or less fully formed and it would be weird to retcon his origin and hatred of Spider Man to use his character the way comic fans would expect.Superhero films have come a long way, but I think a lot of us have lost track of the fact that super powered people in costumes and alien symbiotes are pretty ridiculous when you think about it.  Maybe Venom could have been a better developed film, but it's an alien parasite that eats people and riffs with Tom Hardy's character.  If you aren't expecting The Dark Night or something that is faithful to the comics Venom can be fun.",3

Also to add, I went in with low expectations and I was very well surprised in seeing this new take on the infamous comic book character. I can't wait to see more.Side note: Just gotta have an open mind and accept different takes on things creatively. This take on the character is good one and has my attention on what comes after. There are so many versions of Venom out there too- and this one is just another one that currently shines for me. Hell, maybe we can see a Venom-verse? Once people who are so stuck up understand there is a multiverse full of different versions of the character, they can just drop it and let others enjoy another perspective. Granted, it has the blessing of Stan Lee and Marvel Studios, so I'm totally fine with this. Sony is getting better with being more open to getting help in making a good story.(pardon my bad grammar)",2

"33","Venom","A Step Up For Marvel","Review","December 29, 2018","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",4,"Venom is a commendable divergence by Marvel away from mythology and the uni-dimensional superhero characters of the recent past into a more complex territory of science fiction. Some might call Venom a kind of an optimistic update to the 1978 classic Scifi film ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"", but with many twists.  Tom Hardy brings a comic and subtly self-deprecating dimension into the fold that works very well in his portrayal of Eddie Brock, a journalist with a conscience and Michelle Williams is wonderful as Anne Weying, Eddie's ex-fiancee and a San Francisco district attorney. It is somehow too easy to give too much of this film away by discussing it. Suffice it to say that it is entertaining and worth a look, especially if you have been burned out by too many run of the mill superhero films.",2

"35","Venom","Marvel's The Odd Couple","Fryzilla","January 30, 2019","Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase",3,"Well...this was something. Just to let you know, I love Venom, he's one of the most bad@$$ comic book characters ever, and I was thrilled when I heard there was going to be a movie about him. I saw the trailers for it, and it looked awesome. Then I rented the movie...umm, ok. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the movie, I just don't think it was all that good. While I do think that Tom Hardy was good as Eddie Brock and the design of the symbiotes are pretty cool, especially that slow-mo freeze framing of Venom and Riot fighting with Eddie and Drake fighting along with them (someone should win an award for that scene), I do think that the movie as a whole is a little erratic. Venom himself doesn't appear on screen until the end of the first hour of the movie, although it was pretty glorious when he did. The action and effects were pretty good, although there were times that I couldn't tell what was happening because everything was going too fast. I am a bit disappointed that Spider-Man was not in, or even mentioned in this movie; since, you know, he is a BIG PART OF VENOM'S CREATION! Seriously, how is this a Venom origin story without Spider-Man? I do like the chemistry between Eddie and Venom. What? It's better than that unnecessary romantic subplot with Eddie and his ex-girlfriend. They're like Jekyll and Hyde, if Jekyll was trying to keep Hyde from eating people and end up as total bros. Overall this was a mixed bag for me. It's both good and bad, but it's still an entertaining movie! I just wish it was R-rated like it should have been.",1

Here are some of the worst parts...1. Venom and the other symbiots seem to have a human like form when they come out even though they have supposedly never been in contact with humans.2. They move magically through clothes to take form instead of through the skin like they should.3. There is almost no explanation for why venom helps Eddie except that on Venom's planet he is apparently a ""loser"" as well, subjected to some form of socialization on his planet which seems ridiculous because they need a host to live on earth but on its own planet it's basically a moving blob.4. The symbiotic creatures already have a mind of their own and seem to understand everything going on around them even prior to any human interaction.5. They also claim to know everything about the host, but yet still don't know many things that would seem obvious if it could read the hosts mind.6. The plot never makes you care about Eddie or any of the symbiotic creatures at all.  The entire cast could have died and nobody would have shed a tear.  No character development outside of some fluffy, surface layer type things.Why re-write Venom?  The original story was a MUCH better story than this weird alien sub-culture movie that you see here.

The cgi varies from great in places, to 90s TV show awful in others. The Script is a mess, with sub plots being brought up extremely briefly and never mentioned again, the villains motivations are nonsensical and laughable, and most of the actor's performances come off as OOT or phoned in.The exception being Tom Hardy, who himself does well with what he was given, but the Eddie Brock you know from the comics, this character is not.It's a shame really, because there are moments here that really shine and show potential, most of which you can tell came from the film's intended ""horror"" direction that was clearly scrapped for a by the numbers hero flick.Best thing about about the movie was the credits song by Eminem...and I say that as someone who hates Eminem.Don't buy this film unless you're a die hard Marvel fan who is going to buy them all anyway.",1

"42","Venom","Very fun","Mike S.","January 21, 2019","Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase",5,"This is an MCU adjacent movie. It exists in the world of Spiderman, but the decision was to use it as a stand alone movie without using the black suit version of Spiderman to introduce Venom (as was done in Spderman 3), Therefore, the symbiots were brought to Earth from a space mission, killing all but one of the astronauts. They were discovered by the head of the company that funded the mission called Life Sciences, who then begins experimenting bonding the symbiots with homeless and drug addicted humans. Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock, a former reporter who was fired and now doing freelance work. Of course, one of the symbiots joins with him to form Venom.The movie is a great blend of action and very dark humor. Because they did not use Spiderman, Venom is introduced in the anti-hero version of the character, doing bad things (mainly eating) bad guys. There is a great supporting cast including Jenny Slate, Scott Haze,  Riz Ahmed, and Michelle Williams, who plays the ex-wife of Eddie Brock. She does a really great job playing off Tom Hardy, and brings a lot of the comedy to the movie, which is outside her usual acting roles. The best part of the movie is the discussions/arguments/bickering that goes on between Brock and Venom, mostly in Brock's mind which makes it look to everyone else like he is talking to himself. It also requires Hardy to do a lot of physical comedy, which he turns out to be great at.For those who get the 4K blu-ray, the movie looks and sounds great. On the UHD disc there is only the movie and the into the spiderverse preview. All the other extras are on the regular blu ray. Those include several deleted scenes, including an extended version of the end credits scene which teases where the next movie will go assuming it gets made, then about an hour's worth of making of and behind the scenes material mixed with some featurettes on the history of the Venom character. Definiitely a lot there, and very good.I cannot say everyone will like the movie, and it definitely pushes the PG-13 rating to the limit, mostly because of the language. There is a lot of swearing and some sexually suggestive jokes. It is closer to Deadpool than it is to say Avengers. But it puts a different twist on the MCU movies, and sets up a good possible franchise to exist in that universe. It worth checking out.",NA

"46","Venom","It's nothing special","LaJay","December 23, 2018","Verified Purchase",2,"There's a lot of debate about the origin story this movie was adapted from. Personally, I remember Venom not from the Lethal Protector storyline, so I can relate to people who thought it out of place to see Venom with no relation to Spiderman. Even ignoring that, it was a pretty poorly constructed film.It should have been R-rated. Yep, it really should have been. Venom comics (and a lot of comics, believe it or not) contain a fair amount of blood and violence. Venom is a dark, horrifying character, and the PG-13 rating -- along with the nature of the story and overall writing -- turned him into something about as scary as Smaug from The Hobbit. Like, maybe scary to a 7 year old.Venom should have been an uncomfortable, visceral experience; taunting us to eventually cheer for a murderous alien psychopath -- along with the slimy, self-serving human being he merges with -- who happens to be slightly less murderous than his alien comrades.Also, the CGI and actually the basic design of Venom was pretty bad. It looked more like half-assed claymation than anything else. Also, it reeks of standalone, setting it apart from one of the factors that have made the MCU and the entirety of the comic book universe so successful: crossovers! It's like the creators of this film learned nothing from the mistakes of the early 2000s comic adaptations.Sure, I guess it's ""fun,"" and some people are apologetically calling it ""average."" I just call it a waste of time.",NA

"48","Venom","Ouch.","Micah","October 27, 2018","Format: DVD",2,"It's not as bad as an MCU film, but it looks like Sony intends to head in that direction.This movie feels generic from beginning to end despite that it's centered around some of my favorite comic book characters. It takes SOME ideas from the comics and tries to iterate them somewhat seriously (unlike disneymarvel), but it still likes to throw in some ""haha, it's awkward and/or this really cool character is a failure right now"" jokes, and it makes me sick.As for its regard to the source material, they completely miss the mark with Eddie. They didn't even TRY. This is the first time anyone has tried to make Eddie a complete wuss rather than a sleazy guy with decent goals. He also doesn't have anyone who so personally ruins his life in the film, so the suit has no actual reason to cling to Eddie, let alone call him a good host. There are no rules for what qualifies him as a good host. Symbiotes don't need to feed on anger or hatred, I guess. Not only does this ruin the logic of the movie and spit on the comics (and the intelligence of the audience, while we're at it), but it also completely nullifies the line, ""we are Venom.""Even throughout the film, anyone who says the name ""Venom"" is not referring to Eddie and the symbiote. They're referring specifically to the symbiote. Spider-Man in the suit isn't Venom. Mac Gargon in the suit isn't Venom. Way to absolutely destroy the best part about the character. For that matter, there's even the line ""I am Venom"" in the movie!Riot was poorly executed as well. He's never been a team leader (unless there's a comic about that I'm not aware of; I don't keep up with him in particular). However, Riot does not have a pronounced snout like this film portrays. To make it worse, no Klyntar has ever clung to Carlton despite his complete fascination with them. To make it WORSE, he's played by a middle-eastern youth. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the inclusion of several races and all, but why don't companies make new characters and stories to do it with? That's like making a a new Sonic the Hedgehog game, but Sonic's green and Tails is purple. The goal of cinematic adaptation is to do just that: adapt the characters and concepts to cinema.One thing the film sorta gets right is that the Venom Klyntar was an outcast from his race, but the movie doesn't go anywhere with it, and it manages to screw up details. Instead of explaining that he's actually deemed insane because he wanted to assist hosts rather than consume them, ""I'm kind of a loser."" Really? That's like making Peter Parker wear the mask for kicks instead of protecting people he knows.Lastly, I must say it's an odd choice to have Woody Harrelson play Cletus Kassady. It's not really BAD, but it's about as fitting for the role as Tom Hardy for Eddie Brock.The only REALLY FUN parts of this movie revolve pretty much entirely around Venom himself. It's fun to watch the unique changes in his maneuvers using the wet and sticky physics or pouncing around like an angry, wild, reckless Spider-Man. That's what Venom really should be. Come to think of it, Sony has a bit of a history with getting the action scenes right. They actually make use of a character's traits and allow the character to think based on those traits, and while some other companies do it from time to time, Sony is almost always consistent with it.Eminem tried to destroy the movie, but frankly, I don't think it needed his help.All in all, this movie left me very confused. Riot, Carlton, Anne, and a handful of other concepts in this are all oddly aware of what the comics are like, but the story it tells is detached and not as engaging as it could have been. It feels like a small struggle (but not small enough to be personal, like Venom's grudge with Spider-Man seen anywhere except in Venom's own movie), and you get the happy ending you expected. Worth watching? Ehhhhhh. If you can appreciate some awesome physics being applied to an awesome design in the wrong story, then yeah, it's worth watching. I can't say enough that the visuals and sounds in this movie are SO MUCH FUN, but they deserve more respect and better writing.",21

In an age where Avengers Infinity War came out months before this as the high mark of comicbook movies, this was a huge step BACK to the time when Daredevil and Elektra were the big movie flops.

"55","Venom","If You Were Expecting Better, You Weren't Paying Attention","N / A","March 1, 2019","Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase",3,"An origin story for an iconic character such as Venom easily aroused major interest in the comic book adaptation furor of the modern age. However, that furor should've dissolved by the announcement of its creative team rather than a trailer or PG-13 rating. The director & writers of Venom are responsible for Gangster Squad, The 5th Wave, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, The Dark Tower and Fifty Shades of Grey. If you think that combination would produce another The Dark Knight (2008), The Avengers (2012) or Logan (2017), you were self-deluded (or not paying attention).Venom should've been an unmitigated disaster. However, if one is able to discard all expectation or notion of what a Venom adaptation should be, you might be able to get sucked into the entertainingly vacuous spectacle of it all, which was replete with humor and unapologetic bombast that even at its height feels more measured and considered than the third act of any recent D.C. Extended Universe film where everything descends into people throwing large objects at each other.Venom is not a great film, but its also quite harmless. It sought to be entertaining rather than thoughtful, and achieved that very result. It may be a disappointment to fans wanting a faithful adaptation but as I said before, that expectation should've been dropped upon learning who the director and screenwriters were.",NA

Tom Hardy : Had the role down, the character, I could tell, but the performance wasn't there,The character didn't grow and wasn't presented thoroughly and it showed through the directing. At some point he had the character but it felt like he didn't let character free it was in his head. Venom has a legacy. Sad tho, I really wanted to see him rock it, he was cast well tho.2. Riz Ahmed- Good character, but too much talking, not enough expressive through acting. Almost had it  , but many scenes weren't timed correctly and it appeared not in sync ( between the story line and the actual camera time)..But I did like him as the character, but he needed to be darker(depth).3. Michelle Williams - Good character, good lines, but stood out because of gaps with other characters delivery.4.Venom - He is Venom, outer -space, symbiote, but portrayed as computer generated and voice fx , not modern, no character, all fx.5.

Tom Hardy can't carry the film as much as it tries to make him, and it's very clear that they got halfway through the movie before realizing they needed an antagonist. A interesting first half of the movie suddenly rushes to a close and forces a terrible bad guy in your face for one of the WORST movie boss fights I have ever seen.Like I'll be honest, I was expecting a bad movie from this, but one of those 'so bad it's good' bad movies.

I actually googled ""Venom Wig"", go ahead and see for yourself, I'll wait. It's not just bad, it's reeeeeeeeally awful. What the heck happened. So disappointed.

They certainly could've done better in building a more interesting plot.Overall, though, the movie was truly fun.

Tom is funny as Eddie Brock AND as Venom, he has some really great one liners; the dialogue between the two in the car chase scene and the apartment encapsulates Tom Hardy’s talent as an actor. I would group this in with Deadpool, but it’s much cleaner! The style is much of the same, it’s defintely more for adults, as I think a lot of the darkness and humor would be lost on children.

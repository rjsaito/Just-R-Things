## Synopsis

Welcome! Just R Things is a blog I started in July 2016 to share with the community some cool things that I learned about R programming, Statistics, Machine Learning, R Shiny, Data Wrangling, Visualizations, and more.

This is the repository for all the R scripts and R Markdown files used to product blog posts in Just R Things.

"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Amazing 360 sound quality and upgrades from the original","Style: Phantom Edition",4,"I have a wireless UE Boom speaker so I grabbed the opportunity for a wireless UE Boom 2 speaker.  I've posted a photo to show the differences.  The UE Boom 2 is the one on the right.  While the speakers are the same size, the cases are different.  The amazing 360 sound quality is the same but the wireless range is DOUBLE from the original.  I didn't break out a measuring tape but the claims of 100 ft is about right.  They kept the large + and - volume buttons (just tap to use) which is super convenient and they added the function of tapping the top of the speaker (use two fingers or it won't work) once to pause/play and twice to skip a song.  This feature is very cool but did not work consistently.  They also changed up the recharging and jack features.  They are on the bottom of the Boom speaker and on top under rubber flaps on Boom 2.  I prefer the open ports (more convenient) over the covered but I'm assuming it keeps it cleaner and helps prevent loss of function.  They have also improved the playing time.  I get around 9-12 hours on the original and 10-13 on the Boom 2; granted, a slight improvement but I'll take it.  I cannot find a way to double up a Boom and Boom 2 speaker but I have a call into Logitech to see if this can be configured.  Overall, I LOVE the sound quality, convenience, and mobility these speakers provide and at the same cost as the Boom, I would recommend these for double the wireless range.  I might even spring for the Mega Boom speaker."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great sound for any adventure!","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Logitechs's UE Boom 2 Bluetooth wireless speaker comes packed in a nice container. Which would be great for storing, however, we purchased this for a backpacking trip, so sadly the clamshell packaging won't be used anymore. The attention to detail they took with the packaging gives you a hint about how well engineered this device is. On removing the Boom 2 from the clamshell, you immediately notice it's heft. At 1.2 lbs, it feels solid. The fit and finish are excellent, which is what you should expect from a $200 bluetooth speaker.Both the adapter and the Micro-USB cord come in a bright yellow color, which is very handy when trying to figure out which cord belongs to which electronic device, believe me, I know. The ""Challenger"", comes with a short 1 meter (3.2 feet) versus the UE Boom 2's 4 ft or 1.2 M cable, it makes a huge difference. The Boom 2 also comes with a 2 amp wall ""travel"" adapter, this is handy as it will charge the Boom 2 in about 3 hours, and you can also use it for your iPhone 6 or iPad. The Boombottle does not. You must supply your own (probably repurposed) 1 amp charger. The challenger has a 2,300 mAH battery (2.3 amp hour), while the Boom 2 has a larger battery than it's predecessor (the original boom had 3.7v with 2100 mah) however they most likely upgraded to a larger 18650 cell with 4000 mah to keep the party going for longer. The Boom 2 charges very quickly, in around the 3 hour mark, compared to some other models, that use a 1 amp charger and take 8-10 hours to charge. Li-ion batteries have a finite number of cycles before they die, and you CAN replace them on this unit. Instructions are included on how to do so, but as this hasn't hasn't died yet, I wont be yanking my new toy appart anytime soon.The speaker controls for pause/skip are gesture controls that are only activated once you pick it up, and are controlled with touches on the top. The 3.5mm jack plug and the Micro-USB charging interface are on the bottom, as well as a d-ring for attaching a lanyard. You can remove the d-ring to allow a standard camera mount to screw in. From some of the advertisising, ostenstibly this is to allow you to put it on a stick to help keep it out of water. The headphone jack and charge port are hidden behind covers which fit tightly and make them waterproof, even with the covers uncovered, it is still waterproof. The gesture controls say to pick this up and tap once, with two fingers to play\pause, or two times to skip tracks. However, this has varied in my tests. Perhaps a later update or some muscle memory will yield better results. On a note, when you are charging the Boom 2, you flip it upside down (?) to access the mini-usb port, so the gesture controls cannot be used. To connect to the speaker, just power it on and look through your  bluetooth devices. Once you chose the UE Boom it will ask you if you want the app. You can choose to download the app or not, but you can be up and running in a matter of seconds in either case.The app allows you to add another UE Boom, Boom 2 or UE Megaboom (untested). You can also access a DSP ( digitial signal proecessor) that will give you some preset EQ settings or customize your own setting, giving you control over the output, and tailor it to your liking. Larger units, such as the Megaboom will have a better bass response, and most articles will point out the lack of low end response. Frequency response is billed as 90Hz-20kHz, which means that you will get the more audible bass, but are out of luck for any really deep or bass intense tracks. This unit has slightly larger, (1 3/4"" ) drivers as well as 2 (1 3/4' x 3"" ) passive radiators. The original UE Boom 2013 UE Boom had  two 1.5in drivers and twin 2in passive radiators. While I don't have an original to compare it to, having heard my friends UE Boom before, I have a  feeling that the 90Hz isn't limited by the size of the drivers, but by the DSP to prevent the drivers from bottoming out or distorting. On a note about the DSP, until you hit at least 3\4 volume, the DSP doesnt appear to attenuate the bass (90Hz and up) on all but the deepest tracks. The DSP does a great job of rolling off harmful low frequencies, allowing maximum voume with minimal distortion. You can also power it off or set an alarm, for those that are deep sleepers, and can't be woken up by their puny cell phone speaker. The app also allows you to have total control over the volume, without needing to manually set it on your phone first, then the device. The app will overide your phones volume as you push the buttons on the speaker itself. I found myself leaving my phone in the other room more and more, where before with other products, you had to fiddle with settings or have your phone close by for tweaking the volume. The Boom 2 is IPX7 rated vs the UE Boom (IPX4) which is ""Splash rated"". As I can confirm from having the challenger splashed, the IPX4 rating really means a light splash. The IPX7 rating means it should come out fine after being submerged at 3 feet for 30 minutes (plenty of time to pick up the bottle). Tossing this around at a pool party would probably mean disaster if it sunk in the deep end, but would be fine if dropped in a bathtub. However, I don't want to submerge my new $200 speaker underwater just yet. :).Both the challeneger and the original Boom had a maximum bluetooth distance of about 33 feet if you were lucky and had a clear line of sight (optimal conditions). The Boom 2 claims 100 feet in optimal conditions, and from my testing, it has no problem at all with me leaving my phone in the other room or vice versa. Even through walls it didn't disconnect, whereas the challenger would have trouble maintaining a connection if you walked to the kitchen.They claim this is 25% louder than the original UE Boom, and from the specs, and DSP magic, I am sure it is. I don't have the original boom for reference, but I can tell you, this thing gets plenty loud. It has no problem filling a large room or area with music. At full volume, you basically need to yell at each other to be heard over this thing. As mentioned before, the bass rolls off around 75% volume, and with the magic of the DSP, it still sounds clear even maxed out. Audiophiles, or those without my damaged old ears, might notice some distorotion at full volume, but most will not.Since I am not one to purposefully drop a $200 speaker, I will just go with thier shockproof claims. However, with how rugged this unit is, I dont think an accidental drop from a normal height will do much damage. I cant say the same about some of it's comeptitors though.To conclude, I was a bit leery at the $200 price point, and just happened across this while looking at the original boom. I am glad I purchased this. It absolutely destroys my old bluetooth speaker in every way. My wife, also leery of a $200 bluetooth speaker, loves it. She carries it in the bathroom while getting ready, or just hanging around the house.EDIT: 11/07/2015I was being absent minded, and accidentaly set the business end (the one wiht the 3.5 mm jack and charge port) inot about 3"" of water in my cooler. Don't asl :). I quickly noticed the sound and pulled it out. The sound was more direct, and richer, as my head was directly above the cooler. However, I quickly pulled the UE out and all was rigth with the world. A quick shake off of the UE Boom 2, and no harm no foul. It never skipped a beat.Bluetooth speaker - I would NOT recommned using it as a bluetoooth speaker. No microphone inputs, and the output is way below average. However, I have not been happier with a bluetooth speaker, and my wife loves it so much, she wants to get one for everyone on the list. At $200, thats not going to happen, but I would recommend this to anyone."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Best travel speaker there is. Loud, crisp, easy to use and weather proof.","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Logitechs's UE Boom 2 Bluetooth wireless speaker comes packaged in a nice cylindrical container.  Open the box, which splits down the middle, and on the right you will find the actual Boom speaker and the left contains instructions, a Micro-USB cord and a USB-Mains adapter.Both the adapter and the Micro-USB cord come in a pleasing luminous yellow color which makes it very easy to distinguish when placed in a carry bag alongside a bunch of other cords.  The actual cord length is around 3 feet which should be plenty long for most people.The Boom speaker itself is an art in simplicity.  On the top you have a power button and a Bluetooth connecter button.  On the bottom you have a 3.5mm jack plug and the Micro-USB charging interface.  Both of these are hidden behind covers which fit tightly and make them waterproof.  One face of the almost cylindrical speaker houses two large volume buttons and that is all there is to it really.  The speaker itself is actually quite small, roughly the size of a can of beer so is easily carried around, put in a bag or luggage to take on vacation with you etc.  If you have an Amazon Echo, then the Boom 2 is both smaller and thinner than the Echo as a comparison.Connection to your is simply a matter of pressing the Bluetooth connecter button on the top of the speaker and looking through the list of available Bluetooth devices on your phone, tablet or whatever and selecting the Boom.  Simple as it comes. No codes to type in (it's just a speaker so doesn't really need a security code), no complex do A then B then C etc. steps to take.  You are up and running in a matter of seconds.So what differentiates the Boom 2 from the original?  The Boom 2 is IPX7 rated.  What does that actually mean?  Basically that it's weather sealed.  It has been tested by being submerged in 1 meter of water (3.3ft) for a duration of 30 minutes and still works.  The X in that code means that it hasn't specifically been tested for solid particles but seeing as how it is waterproof it should be protected against sand, dust etc. as well.Another difference between the Boom 2 and the original is that the Boom 2 has a couple of gesture controls built into it.  Pick up the speaker and tap on the top to pause/play music.  Tap twice to skip to the next song.  Note, you do actually have to pick up the speaker to do this.The accepted wireless Bluetooth wireless range has also increased and is now up to 100ft. I tested this by placing both the Boom and the Boom 2 in my garden and basically walking away from them with my phone.  You get to a point where the music being played on the original starts stuttering a bit as its losing connection with the phone but the Boom 2 still plays strongly.  I didn't actually measure how far I had walked but you can go quite a distance whilst still maintaining a solid connection to the Boom 2.Lastly the Boom 2 is slightly louder and has a slightly crisper sound than the original Boom.As mentioned above, sound quality on the Boom 2 is excellent for a portable speaker. Nice deep bass and rich treble tones without sounding tinny or the bass distorting.  The speaker is also loud if turned all the way up.  Until you have the speaker almost at full volume (which chances are you won't as it really is loud) the sound quality hangs in there without getting distorted.There is also an app you can download for IOS and Android that allows you to control the Boom 2 from your phone or tablet.  Note, if you are looking for it on the Apple store whilst using an iPad, it is actually listed as an iPhone product so you may need to switch if you have your default to iPad only apps.The app allows you to turn the Boom 2 on or off, adjust the volume, set an alarm and more importantly gives you a 5 level equalizer to adjust the sound output to your own liking.  It also allows you to double up on your Booms if you own more than one to give you true stereo output.  I tried the app on both my Galaxy S6 Edge Plus and my iPad 2 air and it works as advertised with no problems.The Boom 2 is a great little speaker to take with you when you go on trips.  This past weekend I took it with me to the beach and lay there listening to tunes knowing that I didn't need to take that much care with the speaker to protect it from sand or water.  It worked beautifully.  I'll be taking it again this weekend when I go back down.Battery life is rated at 15 hours although I haven't fully tested that as I don't play music for 15 straight hours but it certainly lasted basically a whole day at the beach with no problems.  Just plug it into the charger overnight and it's ready again to go the next day.  Charging actually doesn't take that long (there is a very small LED light next to the Micro-USB connector on the base which will let you know when the unit is fully charged.  You also get a battery level on the app so you easily monitor how much charge is left in your Boom 2.If you are looking for an excellent portable speaker you can't go wrong with the Boom 2.  Even if you don't travel that often, this is an excellent speaker for the house.  Loud, crisp, easy to use and weather proof."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Very pleased with the full-spectrum sound produced by this great portable speaker","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"The UE Boom 2 is the wireless speaker I've always wanted. Logitech, who is well-known for its quality computer accessories, has applied its engineering skills to create a category-leading Bluetooth speaker. I believe that everyone looking for wireless sound on-the-go should put the UE Boom 2 at the top of their list.I found several things that distinguish the UE Boom 2 from most other wireless speakers I've tried. First, the wrap-around speaker design works really well. It distributes sound all around, filling the room in a way that other speakers cannot. Second, the UE Boom 2 is touch-sensitive.  I can pause and skip songs by tapping once or twice. Third, a free app allows me to customize the EQ settings just the way I want, when streaming music from my iPhone.And yes - as has been suggested elsewhere, the sound output is impressive!  The UE Boom 2 has no problem at all producing rich, deep bass sound (which can often be problematic for small, portable speakers). In fact, I am satisfied with the bass response without pushing the EQ anywhere close to the limit!  The UE Boom 2 handles the treble and mid range sounds just as impressively. All in all, I am very pleased with the full-spectrum sound produced by this great portable speaker.It should also be mentioned that the UE Boom 2 includes a protective case to store the UE Boom 2 and accessories, including instructions, a power plug and USB cable.I highly recommend the UE Boom 2 to everyone."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Good speakers but there are better.","Style: Phantom Edition",4,"I bought two of these about a month ago so I could have the Stero effect outside by my pool area.  If I would have rated this 2 weeks ago I would have given them 5 stars.  Last weekend for the first time since buying these I used them outside as planned.  The volume was set at about 75% and the batters only lasted about 6 hours.  I have a lot of pool parties in the summer and they last way more than 6 hours.  So...I started looking around for a 2nd set that would give me the several mores hours that I needed.I didn't feel like I wanted to pay the price of this speaker again so I started looking for comparable and I came across the JBL Flip 3 speakers.  At a cost of only $99.00 each I thought I'd give them a try.Wow, what a difference.  Now compared to the JBL Flip 3 my UE Boom 2 speakers sound muddled.  The music is sharp and clear with lots of base on my Flip 3's.Now don't get me wrong...the UE Boom 2's are great speakers, but I'm glad I found the Flip 3'sStill a solid 4 star rating for the UE Boom 2...just wish the batteries lasted longer when pushed to near their limit."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Huge mistake but ended up working out","Style: Tropical Edition",5,"So I was a little drunk the other day and got on my wife's amazon account while a little angry and accidentally on purpose 1 click bought what I thought was a 80s themed knock off flesh light. I was wrong. I was excited when opening the package since it really resembles a fleshlight style toy. I almost gave this speaker 1 star because of the wasted 15 minutes I tried using it. Luckily for me this thing is waterproof. But when I read the manual and realized it was a waterproof speaker i decided to try it out. It's got great sound and trust me, it's durable.  You can tell from my picture how I could get it confused."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","What a great product, Made better when you buy two!","Style: Green Machine Edition",5,"The Boom 2 is a Great speaker. I bought the Fugoo to test them side by side and the boom wins hands down. It's louder, and the Bluetooth range is about 3 times the Fugoo. We now have two Booms 2 and together they are AWESOME!!! The sound is really great and I have high standards for speakers. I also want to mention the pair does NOT get interrupted  when a person in in between them. I tested at around 25 feet apart.I was worried the ""15"" hour battery life would only be at lower volumes. We have tested them and at two knotched below max for the full day the speaker lasted a little longer around 16ish hours."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Incredible sound, long-lasting battery, true 360 degrees, long Bluteooth range","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"Incredible sound, long-lasting battery, true 360 degrees, long Bluetooth range. This is the speaker! I purchased a Bose Soundlink Color last year and was extremely disappointed. When there were more than a handful of people around, the Bose just didn't get loud enough, whether we were in a small room or outside at a picnic/bonfire/etc. I'm a casual listener--I just like music--I can't tell you all the specs about bass, sound, etc. I just know what sounds good, and what is loud enough for my liking. I misplaced my Bose, thought it gone forever, so I started researching and the UE Boom 2 sounded like what I was looking for, so I bit the bullet, and boy am I glad I did. I have hung the speaker from the clothesline in the yard and can listen to music while doing yardwork with loud power tools. It is loud enough for get-togethers, both inside and outside. I can hang it from a hook in one room, and the sound reaches all parts of the house. I love listening to the news in the morning while showering, and since it's waterproof, I don't worry about having it in the steamy bathroom with me. If my phone is inside and I take the speaker outside, it maintains a strong, clear Bluetooth connection (I have an old house and sometimes these connections can break when other speakers are just one room away from the source. Not with the UE Boom 2). I am so happy with this purchase and recommend it to anyone just looking for a good, loud, speaker. Only criticism is the shape. The loop (for a carabiner or lanyard), charging port, and 3.5mm aux port are on the bottom. And the power button is on the top. I always keep a carabiner connected, and when listening to music from my PC, I have to use a 3.5mm aux cable. So that means I have to set the speaker on its top, so the power button is inaccessible as well as the tap sensor (which doesn't work well anyway--you can tap once to pause, twice to skip to the next song. I turned if off in the app cause it does't work). You can't keep the speaker on its side because it will roll, particularly if you have kids, animals, people around. It has to sit up or down (like in the stock image). It's a cool shape though cause you can stick it in a bottle holder on a bike for bike rides. I guess I just wish the buttons and ports were all on the same side so that the ""bottom"" were a proper bottom that you didn't have to access."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Beautiful sound and appearance!","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Looks great, sounds great, excited to bring this on adventures this Summer! I would highly recommend this speaker. The only thing I dislike is the tap to pause function is a little finicky. I previously owned a Mini Jambox by Jawbone and the sound quality on this is a HUGE step up from that of the Jambox."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","FANTASTIC!","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"I had a wireless UE Boom speaker before, but I decided to get the wireless UE Boom 2 speaker as well.They do look similar, they almost the same size, but the UE improved the speaker a lot.Here are some differences between UE Boom 2 and the original UE Boom:- fully waterproof (iPX7 -- immersion up to 1 m for 30 minutes)- drop-resistant to five feet- sounds 25% louder- enhanced sound- wireless range up to 100 feet- external charge is waterproof (not water resistant)- a few grams heavier than the older version- gesture control- you can update the speaker's firmware over the air via app- you can turn the speaker on and off via the app - super convenient!I totally love UE Boom 2!Its amazing 360 sound is the best I’ve heard from a speaker this size. It also very loud ( I personally wouldn’t need UE Boom Mega).It sounds perfectly natural at moderate levels.The battery lasts for 15 hours at moderate volume, which is pretty long.I absolutely fell in love with the accelerometer.I can skip or pause songs by tapping the speaker while holding it.Once the Boom 2 senses you’re holding it, you can pause or ‘unpause’ songs by smacking the top. If you smack twice, you’ll skip to the next song.I was seriously impressed by the wireless range of the speaker. During one of our hiking trip, my friends and I were playing music from my phone.Forgetting about it, I put iPhone into my pocket and walked away to bring more wood.My friends wouldn’t even notice that the phone was far away from the speaker if they weren’t trying to find it to change the playlist!Also, I did tested its water resistance in the bathtub. I didn’t keep it under the water for more than a few seconds, but it was definitely waterproof.All ports are sealed with rubber gaskets and little flap-doors, so the whole speaker is basically sealed against water or dirt.The speaker is very easy to set up with any of your bluetooth divide.Also, it shuts off automatically when not in use.I totally recommend it!I’m using it every day. It is great shower speaker.The speaker is small and portable. Great  as travel speaker. I always take it when camping, road tripping or even hiking.The speaker is rugged, coated in rubber, waterproof and extremely durable.I love its sound quality, mobility and convenience.Worth every penny!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","You won't believe how good it sounds.","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"You won't believe how good the sound is. We re-did our kitchen a few years ago and had nice speakers and a sub-woofer installed in the ceiling over the chairs at the island. Best decision we ever made, we play music through AirPlay from our Apple devices, and route the TV's output through them and it's so easy to hear the dialog. So what!?This little speaker is so good, half the time we use it instead of our fancy overhead speakers. Best of all, you can get the Megaboom app for iPhone and Android and yes *two* at once to get stereo. I haven't done this, but the  two friends whose kids I gave the 'UE Boom 2', one each; they paired them at the ski cabin they rented and said it was amazing.Excellent product."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Fantastic sound from a hardy, waterproof, rugged speaker!","Style: Cherrybomb Edition",5,"I absolutely love my new UE Boom 2 Wireless Bluetooth speaker!  I did lots of research and was thinking about getting a Bose, but I am so happy I got this one!.  I got this one as it seemed more rugged.  It is waterproof and will be great to take camping and other places with me.  I love that it can team with other peoples' UE Boom 2's.  It has a fantastic sound to it; much better than I would have expected.  I cannot imagine Boise being that much better.  I've heard the sound from the Boise is better, but the sound and volume capacity on this one are fantastic!  It is easy to sync with  and easy to use!  It has such fun colors too!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Awesome. Just awesome.","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"I absolutely adore the Boom 2. I am using these in small conference room spaces currently for webinars and other web conferencing. The sound quality, both in and out, is great. The ability to pair two has made these viable in larger spaces and has helped us limit the need to speak louder than normal for others to hear on the other end of a web call. Plus, when it's time to put on some of our favorite jams, they thump with the best of them."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Amazing sound and range","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"I received this speaker through a deal with Verizon.  This speaker syncs quickly with our iPad 2, Droid turbo, and Moto x.  The range is fantastic.  I can leave my phone in any room in our house and take the speaker to any other room and even outside and it stays connected.  I'm not an audiophile but in my opinion the sound is great.  Music sounds amazing and audio books sound like the narrator is sitting in the room with you.  It has a nice feature where it will turn off automatically if you are no longer listening to anything so no more battery drain!  The price is a bit higher than I would have paid had I not gotten a deal but I'm very happy with this speaker!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","So worth it!","Style: Tropical Edition",5,"I was a little leery about paying this much money for a ""smallish"" Bluetooth speaker. But, these seemed to be well-regarded, and I wanted a new speaker to take on a week's vacation with me.Soooooo glad I got this thing! The sound is great - clear sound and enough bass to fill a good sized room easily! The battery lasted a whopping long time (using it several hours a day throughout the week's vacation, and I only had to recharge towards the end of the week)! The thing feels very tough and I'm digging the funky color-combo I got mine in.I traded up from about a $40 Bluetooth speaker that's probably half the size of this thing. But I think I got sound that's way more than twice as good as what I had before! I think this thing is worth every penny I paid for it!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Fantastic sound and build quality","Style: Yeti Edition",5,"The sound from this BT speaker is fantastic!  Crisp highs, great mids and vocals, and nice bass (although this would be the weakest range since this is not a large speaker, but still very good).  I have been impressed with just how good it really sounds.  It's built tough, syncs quickly, and is very portable.  Battery life seems to be as UE has stated.  I have no complaints and only praise for this speaker.  Would defnitely turn around and buy another without question."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Love it!!","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"So I just picked this up 2 days ago and I love it!! I have been a fan on the original UE boom for about 2 years and didn't realized they released a new model. Right when I found out I could not wait and instead I went to a local store to pick it up. Normally I would buy through amazon but could not wait for shipment to arrive. Lets just say there is a difference! The sound is a little bit more crisp and when you do compare between the old model and new of the UE boom you notice that it is louder. This is from just comparing it for about 5-10 minutes. Also I am not an expert or anything. But I can tell a difference in the sound quality and also the loudness. I am pretty happy with it so far.  It feels very sturdy and is similar size to the previous model. The only thing I would say is I am not sure about the battery life. The original UE boom they said it last about 15 hours but that is playing low music. I play mine pretty loud normally because I am at social events and it last about 3 hours. Well now this new model is more powerful and even louder so lets see how long the battery life will be. Either way I am happy with it and would recommend."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","UE Boom 2 Speaker Provides, Rich, Full, Stereo Sound on the go! Great Battery Life! A Must Have!","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"*************Update 2/14/16*******************************After less than 6 months, this speaker will no longer hold a charge. Amazon doesn't allow changes in the ratings, but I can no longer recommend this product. It is ridiculous that a supposed well made product can't last 6 months. Find another speaker & skip this.This Logitech Wireless Bluetooth Speaker is awesome! It arrives in a nice tube tucked inside an outer sleeve. The tube opens to show the speaker on one side and a compartment containing an informational insert, charging cable and adapter on the other. The speaker itself weighs only a few pounds and is very comfortable to hold in your hands. The soft rubber grip is very comfortable. It is also easy to clean and waterproof. It turns on by pressing the LED indentation at the top. A sound like bongo drums alerts you that the speaker is on. There is a second small round indentation above the LED turns the Bluetooth feature on. There is a companion app that you can download to provide interaction with the speaker. The app is fantastic! You can check the battery status (you are supposed to be able to check on the speaker itself by pressing on the front, but I could not get the right combination.) in app and it also shows next to my battery icon on my phone. The app gives instructions, allows you to connect to several speakers at one time, balance the EQ, set alarms and more. It also controls updates, which are wireless. Updating requires your device to be near and only take a few minutes, with the speaker restarting soon after. Pairing is easy and smooth. The sound is incredible! Rich, full, stereo sound is wonderful! I use mine at work since the speaker died and it sounds incredible. The battery life is pegged at 15 hours. I play mine for about 7 hours at work and it uses little power. I now use this more than my old Sony that I used with my old iPhone 4. Old iPhones can be great for music, I use them for music, like an iPod. Lightweight and easy to carry and use, This speaker is awesome! I didn't think I would like it, but I really love this. I highly recommend this."

They could probably reduce the price by $5 by slimming down the packaging.VERDICT:-Lacks the amazing sound quality of the Bose Soundlink Mini (I've seen reviews stating they have the same sound quality), but is probably the better choice if you ever plan to take your speaker around. It's insanely loud for its size, has gread app support, and is pretty much lifeproof. I was a tiny bit let down by the lack of bass at full volume, but full volume is so loud I will hardly ever turn it up that loud. For $150, this speaker is 100% worth it."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Solid product","Style: Green Machine Edition",4,"Many reviews of portable speakers have this as a top consideration, which is why I did. It does suit a very cool, portable, solid, and multi-useful product.The sound is fine, not excellent. I'm a music guy, so others who aren't so discernible would be fine. Doesn't sound as good as my not-so-portable Bose; but therein lies the difference."

He loves it. I got the 2 year service protection plan with it and I also got him a case too since he is rough on stuff. We first saw the speaker at an AT&T store for about $20 more and it only came in one color (black). I am glad that I checked on Amazon and realized that there are other color options."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","These are not inexpensive, but you WILL NOT be disappointed. This is an amazing piece of technology","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"This UE Boom 2 is possibly the best unit available for those looking for quality, ruggedness and style. As at home on a table in your living room as on a stump at your next camp out. Simply an amazing piece of technology. The UE Boom 2 some features that the original does not. Full IPX waterproof vs water resistant + more."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Really nice... if you're using the UE phone app.","Style: Phantom Edition",4,"A couple of points I haven't seen mentioned in anyone else's review...1 - The speaker is actually pretty slick, but only after you fire up the UE Android app. It offers you several audio presets, but to really hear it sing you need to tinker around with the equalizer. The speaker is muddy and under-whelming without it.2 - The equalizer only works while connected via Bluetooth. If you'd hoped to plug in a cable and get crisp tunes you're going to be disappointed. The speaker needs to connect wirelessly in order for the settings to have an effect. The second I click off my phone, or switch to another BT device, the defaults kick in and I'm back to muffled sound. Logitech says there's no work-around for this.3 - The UE app allows you to choose whether you want to send call audio and/or media audio to the speaker. Unfortunately, if both are turned off, the speaker disconnects and I lose the equalizer again. That means that whenever my phone reports a new text message, the audio I'm pushing via cable gets interrupted. I have to pause the music and restart it to resume playback.3 - The speaker powers off if it sits dormant for about 15min. I'm in a customer-service business and frequently have to pause my music to take a phone call or have a conversation. That means every time I sit back down, I have to power my speaker back up. No way to disable this feature.4 - Volume is terrific.5 - Battery life is exceptional.6 - Construction is solid and I don't fear incurring damage from this guy bouncing around my backpack.7 - Speaker must be stood upright, and sounds best when the keys are facing you. Would have been nice for Logitech to include a stand of some kind that would prevent knocking it over so easily, or at least let us lay it down.SUMMARY: It's a good addition to my traveling workstation, but some of the points made above have been mildly irritating. With the equalizer effects, I love this thing. Without that, I'd have felt cheated to pay so much for such mediocre sound (defaults)."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Love it","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"Amazing sound. Insane battery life + waterproof. What more could one ask for! There more- I aboaultely Love the ue boom  app that lets you pair speakers+ Remotely switch on and off the speaker , set the equaliser and set an alarm through the speaker. Speaker phone needs some working on - there's some echoing ( I'm sure that'll be fixed son with an update). Would highly recommend this speaker"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Bluetooth Blast","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"After buying the two Rolls for travel.I was very pleased with this line of speakers.So I ordered one Boom 2.After listening to the Boom 2,I had to get another one so I can sync them and have one on each side of the bed.Great Sound and solid build makes me want to give this speaker a great review.Would recommend to anyone."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","A Worthy Upgrade to an Already-Great Product","Style: Tropical Edition",5,"Over the past few weeks, I’ve been listening to the current-generation of Ultimate Ears’ Bluetooth Speaker lineup; the UE Megaboom, UE Boom2, and UE Roll. This comes after owning the original UE Boom for about two years, and listening to is almost daily in my car, at home, in my office, and in parking lots while putting on ski gear. That’s to say, I have a lot of experience with the Boom, and know how it sounds. First, the flagship of the line is the original Boom – called the Boom2 in its current generation. It’s mid-sized in the lineup, and straddles the line between portability and sound quality.The cool thing about the Boom2 is it’s broad appeal to a bunch of audiences. The speaker is small and portable, so makes a great travel speaker if weight isn’t your primary concern. Think travel like car camping, road trips, tour groups (the kind with rolling luggage, tour busses), etc. The speaker is rugged, coated in rubber, and waterproof – so it’s great for busy families with rowdy kids knocking things over, great to drag around the vacation house out to the edge of the hot tub or to the side of the pool. The Boom2 also has singular, handsome looks, and is right at home (in some of the colors) on the edge of the desk (where I have mine right now), on the kitchen bar, or in the middle of the cocktail table. The one place where it’s not the best is for more permanent installation – yes, the speaker can be powered and charged from MicroUSB, and has a line input port –  but they’re on the bottom of the unit. So if you want to use the Boom2 while plugged in, connected to the aux audio port, have access to the top power and pair buttons, and have it in the “correct” orientation for the side-firing stereo speakers (with treble on top and bass on bottom), then you’ll have to use the tripod screw mount to elevate the speaker up a bit. Kind of weird. But anyway, the Boom2 is great for portability.LikeThe Boom and Boom 2, when Doubled Up, each act as a stereo speaker individually, playing the same audio source. That makes sense, since the Boom and Boom 2 aren’t acoustically identical, so using each as one side of a stereo pair would be weird. I assume that if I were to double up two Boom 2’s, each would act as one side of a stereo pair. I can’t try this because I only own one Boom 2.The sound quality is a definite improvement form the OG Boom. It’s clearer, and gets considerably louder without distorting. I noticed that as the volume is turned up, the Boom2 seems to adjust the EQ accordingly, so nothing gets distorted, but the volume increases. I’m not a huge fan of this, but it works to consistently squeeze acceptable sounding audio out of a relatively small speaker. The only way to do this without a computer controlled EQ would be to just build a bigger speaker… which is not the point here.The pairing process of the Boom2 is a breeze. Additionally, it pairs quickly with my iPhone when I turn it on, and has a much longer Bluetooth range than the original Boom.The volume of the Boom2 is controlled directly from my iPhone. This is a small detail, but important. When I click the volume buttons on my phone, the actual volume of the Boom2 changes. This is in contrast with the other, less-good method of volume control, where I change the volume on my phone, giving the speaker a “hotter” output, but the actual volume setting of the device is independently controlled on the device. With the Boom2, these two volumes are one and the same, which I like a lot.I love squeezing the Boom2 and hearing it tell me how much battery I have left.For the size of this thing, the sound is really really fantastic. Sure it doesn’t have the best most ground shaking bass, but it sounds good in almost all regards. Music sounds smooth and pleasing. Podcasts are clear. And the speakerphone function works as it should. The FLAC files I listened to sounded good too – but no better than the compressed tracks I listened to on Spotify. I’d say if you’re looking for an audiophile grade speaker that will really make your super high end audio tracks shine, this is not the speaker. But for rocking out to Spotify tracks, this thing is really great.Don’t LikeIn “Double Up” mode, paired to my original UE Boom, I experienced a good amount of crackling and sound dropouts on the Boom 2. In this mode, it appeared that my phone was paired over bluetooth to the Boom, and then the Boom was paired to the Boom 2, sending audio data. I’m not sure if this is an issue with the Boom sending audio data to the Boom 2, the Boom 2 receiving the audio stream, or some other linking issue between the Original Boom and Boom 2 – but it was a pain to deal with. Of note, the speakers were about 15 feet from each other, and the Boom was 10 feet from my phone, in a normal living room, both with charged batteries, latest firmware.The color of my Boom 1 is orange rubber and a purple grille. How horribly ugly, and unfitting in any decor. I understand that it’s fun and youthful, but for my desk space, it sticks out like an eyesore. Luckily, Logitech does sell Boom 2 in more subdued colors.The motion activated functions – tap tap for track skipping etc – I don’t care. I never used these except to test that they work. And even when I was using the speaker in a more “dynamic” environment.. with friends rocking out in a parking lot before skiing – my phone was never so far away that I felt I needed to pick up the speaker to change the track. It just seems like an unnecessary feature.On a few tracks, the super low bass does get cutoff. I know this is because of its small size, but still, I really love that deep bass in XX’s “Fantasy”.I wish the audio in, charging ports were all on the top, so i could keep this thing standing up correctly while charging, connecting to external audio, etc. I know it’s easy enough to turn over, but it still seems upside down when I do that.Should you buy it?If you’re looking for a super versatile,  great sounding Bluetooth speaker that will sound great in normal rooms in your house, and have good chops for rocking small parties as well as your campsite, get this one. It’s totally usable in the widest range of situations I can imagine, and looks great doing it."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Stop shopping, just buy this speaker.","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Put simply, it's the best sound I've heard from a bluetooth speaker. I've tried jazz, hip hop, folk, rock, country - doesn't matter, the range and clarity on this speaker is incredible. I don't have a single complaint. Good battery life, solid speaker, works all the time. Sometimes there's an issue pairing, but that is likely more with the iPad than it is with the speaker as it has happened to other bluetooth devices.The app could use some work, but you only need that if you are linking 2 of them. For just the speaker itself, I'd give it 6 stars if I could."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great Rugged Speaker","Style: Yeti Edition",4,"Awesome speaker, super rugged and love that it's waterproof. The UE Roll is possibly better value depending what you're looking for. I highly recommend adding a small carabiner to the bottom ring so that you can hang it easily from things, like the UE Roll (A carabiner should really be included)ProsSuper loud for its size, great sound, easy connect, nice app, really long battery, rugged, waterproof. If you want a speaker for outdoor activities, and that you don't have to baby, this is it!Negatives (overall great, but here are a few areas for improvement)-Wish there was a dedicated next/play button. The tapping feature is very unreliable.-I love using it for phone calls, e.g. cooking in the kitchen and being able to talk to the person like they are there, but, the unit is giving lots of echo for the person on the other end, very annoying for them. The same thing happens with some bluetooth headphones, but not others. No serious help been given from UE.-Very hard to pair it with a UE Roll, since they each have their own apps - I imagine pairing it with another UE Boom 2 is easier, so this is a weird specific use case."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","UE You nailed it with this one!!!","Style: Green Machine Edition",5,"OMG, this thing is amazing. I have taken it everywhere. The sound is amazing, to test it we cranked up AC/DC full blast and it was clear as a bell, no distortion. I have found that with any music I play is clear and it will rattle the windows with a good base line. I have amazon prime, so I have the amazon music and just download it to my phone and set the speaker by the pool, instant party. Easy 100 ft range, battery life is good as long as you don't crank it up all the way, if you do, it reduces the life to about half, but that's still 5-7 hrsMake sure to download the app and immediately update it, there are some neat features in it. I am seriously considering getting a couple more just to have around the house, so I can pipe music through out."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","UE BOOM 2 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker gets the job done and more!","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"While I have not experimented on various bluetooth speakers like the UE BOOM 2, from my personal experience of using this device, I can easily say that my first experience with this device has been wonderful.The first thing I did was test it on an iPhone 6 and an HTC Android phone and pairing was quite easy.  Click on the button on top and go to your phone settings and it discovers the device and pair it via Bluetooth.  So easy!It's important to note that if you have multiple devices, it's best not to have them all on, if you want to switch one off to use the UE BOOM 2.But it's very easy to use and this thing is quite loud and sounds crystal clear.For my first time testing it over many hours non-stop, while I worked in the garage, this device was going strong for more than 10 hours (it supposedly has a 15 hour battery life) and I was running from my Mac to the garage, which is about 75 ft. and through a wall and still the signal was clear.  I was able to play Internet radio, YouTube and other media from my devices with no problem.It was easy to pause, skip through a song.  I also tested with my iPad, HP Slate and LG Android tablet with no problems.If there was any difficulty, the hardest part was trying to figure out how to open the case in which the speaker was stored.  But other than that, using this speaker right out of the case and also later recharging is quite simple (it comes with a 3 foot USB cord and adapter) and quick.The app for iOS and Android are similar and both are easy to use, pair multiple UE BOOM 2, set sound settings and more.And also updating the speaker was quite easy as well.While I didn't want to chance the waterproof test, everything about this speaker has worked wonderfully.The cylindrical style is quite stylish.JUDGMENT CALL:For its price and its crystal clear sound, the UE BOOM 2 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker is fantastic for those who want something simple and  inexpensive.  Up to 15 hours and ease of use is a plus.  While, I'm not an erudite on Bluetooth speakers, nor do I own anything else to compare it with, I can say that it's not bass heavy, it's more average.  It does deliver with 360 sound and is quite loud.I haven't had problems with Bluetooth pairing, nor did I have a problem nor have I had dropoffs.  The only thing is switching to various Bluetooth devices.  It's first come first serve of which device utilizes the UE BOOM 2 for pairing, but this is easily remedied by turning off a device or unpair it.For those considering it, it shows that the device works for iOS devices but it does work for Android devices as well.  Pretty much most things that have Bluetooth where you can pair it with this speaker.But for my experience alone, I absolutely am enjoying this UE BOOM 2 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker and can easily recommend it!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Better than my other speakers","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"I have both the Boom 2 and the Bose Soundlink mini and find myself using this one the most. The sound is full and rich and can fill easily fill a room and, to my ears,the sound is as good as that which I get from my Bose Soundlink mini.  It also  holds a charge better than the Bose and therefore is better to take on a trip.. Also, the Bose is not the type of speaker to take outside or on a trip. In summary, I am really glad I purchased this speaker."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","GREAT Portable Speaker with Many Features (I list them)","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"My first experience with Ultimate Ears was with their 350 series headphones. Those amazing headphones, on sale for only $10 sounded like $250 headphones! I bought the Boom 2 from Best Buy. Here is what I LOVE about this speaker* Inviting to grab and move. Unlike bigger and bulkier speakers called portable, in real life, those kind of speakers do not ""invite"" you to grab and take with you like the Boom 2. It is a pleasure to hold in the hand.* Great Bluetooth connectivity. I love how it instantly connects with no problem when I turn it on, or turn on my cell's Bluetooth* Great battery life. 15 Hours is solid.* 360 degree sound distribution. How many portables can claim that?* Lightweight.* Stereo Imaging. Very important to consider when comparing sound quality, and most portables lack this feature.* Great sound. I listen to a lot of I heart radio news and ESPN radio. Great sound with spoken word as well as music.* Great volume. Although I rarely listen at high volumes, this is capable of big volume.* Track controls and pause/play with a ""tap"" or 2. (I have not figured out how to do this yet, but I am sure I will.)* Truly portable. If you cannot carry it comfortably around the block, then it is not really portable.* Very high quality construction.* Replaceable battery. It does take some tools and work,but the battery can be user replaced. The instructions to do so are in the box. So a couple years down the road when the battery starts to lose its full strength, you can replace the battery.* Can be used as speakerphone for phone calls.* Can be used for ""ok google"" commandsAs a portable speaker addict who has been through virtually all the big name portables: Marshall, Bose, JBL, Monster, etc...I consider this my favorite ""larger than shirt pocket"" size speaker. My favorite truly shirt pocket sized speaker is the Harmon Kardon Esquire"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Decent sound, beautiful-looking, slightly pricey speaker.","Style: Tropical Edition",4,"PEOPLE - Please note that you CANNOT get loud, deep bass from a small speaker cone.  It's against the laws of physics.  Therefore, I am being reasonable when I review small speakers. Overall, this very cool-looking speaker sounded pretty darn good. Of course, it sounds better indoors, where is does not ""work"" as hard. The battery lasts a pretty long time. It's an object of beauty (in my opinion). The only down side is - $179 is a tad pricey. The UE Boom 2 would sell out of it was $149. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Love it!","Style: Tropical Edition",5,"Amazing sound and I am absolutely in love with this speaker!BOOM 2 has made my life so much more fun because I love music and play it all day long! I can have this play music anywhere, and not only that but with a good quality sound. I also love the bright and fun modern orangey color! The battery lasts up to 15 hours.It is absolutely amazingly easy to operate the speaker. My only complaint is towards Apple - if the wifi signal is not as strong as 30-50 mbps the stupid Mac Pro Retina (which I paid for more than $3500) has trouble transmitting the sound?! It's very annoying to have a ""super computer"" in hands, which cannot perform the simplest of things. Thankfully most of the time my home wifi signal is around 50 mbps and I don't have that problem at home. Only when I travel the Mac becomes useless for playing music and I have to use my phone.You have to trust Logitech to make a product with a very good quality sound!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Unimpressed","Style: Phantom Edition",2,"I've had this speaker for a while now and I waited to do a review because I thought I would warm up to itit somehow. It's now safe to say I'completely unimpressed. I bought it primary for biking to put in my bottle cage. I have used a Big Jambox for like 3 years and it's great but kind of bulky. I need a large rack to carry it. My new bike doesn't have room so I tried the UE Boom.The good:The speaker is plenty loud and the sound quality is decent. Not great but good enough for a ride or mood music on the deck. The small size of the speaker is great. I can toss it in shoe and into a suitcase and travel with it easily.The Bad:They advertise these speakers can be linked up to one another, up to 100 feet away. IF you can get them to link, which is usually about 30% of the time it's great. However bikes must be huge at the UE factory because real life is 2 bike lengths. Not 3!  2 bikes between the 2 speakers before the music starts skipping all over on the slave speaker. That's what....12 feet?? Pretty short of 100 foot advertised range.The battery life on this speaker is also absolutely awful. I had it plugged in overnight. Left on a ride at 100% charge. An hour and 52 minutes later (recorded on my bike computer) the lovely voice came in and said battery level critical. Then it turned off. NOT EVEN 2 HOURS?! Unacceptable for a speaker at this price point and especially one that claims such a high battery. That's just plan comical. My Big Jambox might have been bulky but at least the claims of 20 hours were closer to accurate. I've gotten 15+ more than once.All in all I gotta be honest, I'm sorry I bought this. A friend keeps telling me he Megaboom is better. It's fit a better battery life. Sorry man, I'm so unimpressed with the Boom 2, there is no way I'm going back to pay double for its big brother."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Awesome sound...","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"I'm very impressed with the sound. It's also a perfect size and weight for moving around and sitting in different places in the house. It also seems to be solidly constructed. I liked mine so much that I dropped another 200 balloons to get one for my father as a Christmas gift... Only real con is the lack of a straight out pause/stop button on the device."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Perfect speaker accessory!","Style: Cherrybomb Edition",5,"Absolutely LOVE the UE Boom, it has a great quality sound and its the perfect size for carrying around or traveling with. I love the Cherry color I chose, I was going to get the standard black one but wanted to get something a little more fun and interesting. This Cherry color pops in person and is even more vibrant in real life than the picture you see online, which is exactly what I was hoping for. This is a great speaker accessory that I can use at home or travel with and looks appealing!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","BOOM-TASTIC!","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"This is a totally unbiased review:This thing is awesome. Been wanting to buy a bluetooth speaker for a long time, but never had the patience to check them out. Then I saw a review (a few actually) on sites like CNET that recommended this one; they said the original was great/one of the best out there and then they went ahead and made it better. Trusting the site(s), I decided to just get this one and try it out. These types of speakers usually suffer from muffled sound, too much bass, too little bass, etc., etc., but HOLY MOLY! THIS THING ROCKS! The sound is clear, it feels substantial and well constructed. HIGHLY recommended!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great Quality and Value.","Style: Tropical Edition",5,"I got this to replace my Big Jambox, which I loved. The demise of my jambox was repeated use at the beach which led to sand/water eventually ruining it. I decided to try a different speaker, one that would hopefully stand up to the elements a little better. The UE Boom 2 has very good sound quality, even when the volume is all the way up - and it gets very loud. If turned all the way up while in the house, it's actually too loud. The UE Boom 2 has been primarily used at the beach and have no issues with hearing the music even when you're not near the speaker. The fact that it's waterproof and seems to be fairly sand/dust proof, and durable overall, are big pluses. Bluetooth connection is easy and effective. I'd highly recommend this speaker."

"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Fantastic build quality, sound in a small package","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Really enjoying using this wireless speaker. Bought it for use on the golf course and this thing fits perfectly in the cup holders. Sound quality is very good for the size and build quality is amazing. Great user interface, and I've had no problems connecting bluetooth with my iPhone and utilizing the app. Buttons work great and provide good tactile feedback. For those struggling with the tapping functionality at the top to skip songs, I've found that you have to tap relatively slowly. Fast taps do not work. Overall great choice and I'm very happy with the purchase."

"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","I LOVE this speaker. Used mostly with my iPhone 6s.","Style: Yeti Edition",5,"I really love this speaker.  It can get real loud and music sounds good from it.  The pairing is probably the EASIEST I have ever experienced.  It synced in seconds and maintains the connection beautifully.  I LOVE that it's waterproof so I can listen to it in the shower without worrying about it.  It's a lot smaller than I expected which is awesome. Super small with super big sound.  It doesn't maintain any kind of connection remotely close to 100 FT but companies make false Bluetooth range claims all the time.  It's closer to 30 FT which is good enough for my purposes in most situations I'm in.  I bought the gorgeous Yeti color and my only complaint in this is with the god awfully ugly yellow charger cable and plug. I appreciate the tangle free design but the yellow color is hideous and clashes horribly with the white unit. I wish they had gone with a white or black color and I'd have preferred the normal, round cable design instead of the flat design but it's the color that's horrid. I keep the cable out of sight.  Other than that, this speaker is a must MUST have. Although I usually use it with my iPhone 6s, I've also began using it in place of my Macbook Pros built in speaker.  After using the UE Boom, I realized how tinny my Macbook Pro built in speakers are in comparison."

I am sure there are other speakers on the market in this same price range that are equal to and potentially perform better, but I have no regrets on making this purchase.

There's not a lot of bass but they do have pretty good range - definitely does not muddle any of the music. Tested against a wide range of music, including classical, alternative, rock, and EDM.

"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Good buy and satisfied","Style: Tropical Edition",5,"Absolute love this thing, the bass is good and the speaker gets very loud. I have many BT speakers and most recently used Pyles splash proof rugged one. That's much heavier than this but the range of the BT is seriously short. So I decided it was time for an upgrade. Got an amazing price on this particular color in an open box scenario and at first I thought I was going to have a problem as it paired but no sound came out. I factory reset the speaker and now it's a dream. Pyles speaker is much cheaper and the doesn't sound as good very loud but has a deeper bass, but that doesn't matter if you can't get a clear sound loud. I mainly use the speaker for watching tv shows and movies, only play music to clean the house. I'm overall very pleased with this speaker."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great speaker with strong sound.","Style: Phantom Edition",4,"UE BOOM 2 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker - Phantom Edition is a well made speaker, that has good sound, waterproof and easy to set up and use.I cannot review how the packing for the actual purchased item is as I received a 'review' product that is just the speaker wrapped in plastic with a cardboard sleeve, no box or packing and instruction book on the outside under the plastic. If you buy the product I imagine you will receive a much more well packaged item. So my review is limited to what I received and might vary a bit from the actual product purchased.The speaker itself is good sized. 8 inches tall and 5 inch across. Connecting it to a bluetooth device is very simple. The instructions are clear and it connects fine. The additional software you can download gives you even more functions and I do recommend that you install it. The sound is nice and bright with a good bass tone.This speaker was used both inside and outside at a party we had. I wanted to see how the sound quality was in different environments. I can say it does give enough volume to be used in both. We were at a park when using it outside and it provided enough sound for us to enjoy the music, but not so loud to be an annoyance to others there.Set up is easy, controls are very simple to use, it is waterproof if needed, extra software for more features are available, it comes with the needed cables to charge and connect device, and is compact enough to take with you. The UE BOOM 2 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker - Phantom Edition has all the features you could want in a speaker of this type. One star off because I do think its a bit overpriced. Being priced as high as it is will prevent most people from buying a second one to pair with it, which would be great.Quality wise this us an excellent product. Recommended."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Save for the Megaboom","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Good dynamic range and a reasonable amount of compression detectable at higher volumes (although most audiophiles know compression is a loudness and power-consumed type of calculation). I bought this product in hopes of putting it in the bottle cage of my bike. Sadly, it is too small for most cages. If I had known that, I would have perhaps purchased the Megaboom. I still might, but I digress.I would recommend the Boom 2 for the college student looking to get others to appreciate music. As some of the other reviews had mentioned-one can only pack so much into a confined space. The smaller the cone and driver, the worse the sound quality. For the size, Logitech has definitely hired the right engineers on the UE line of products.Some genres really pop with this unit, especially if they stick around the mid range-soft rock, rock, jazz, and motown are good examples. Saxophone and acoustic guitar sounds unbelievably crisp and clear. Genres with lower frequencies I would stay away from- metal and R&B especially. If you're a Five Finger Death Punch or Snoop Dogg fan, this is not really the speaker for you...that is, if you haven't heard songs in that genre on an actual stereo (LCR,SW). Having my own THX Pioneer system to compare this speaker to, lots of high and low noises are almost ignored by the Boom 2. But if you've never had an actual stereo to compare to, you will be thoroughly happy. It's better than any Bose Headphone or cheap soundbar out on the market. If this speaker is in your financial lane, pick it up and you'll be happy. If you possess the ability to demonstrate self-control to save your money, get the Megaboom. Although I have not physically heard it first hand, the unit is larger and based on the same technology as the Boom and Boom 2. For $100 more, I'd say it would be worth it.  Who knows, if you're even more attentive to self-control...there might be a Megaboom 2 soon...You know, if you are really about getting into quality sound and experiencing music, check out Bowers & Wilkins. I am sure there is a display somewhere local that you can find a setup to listen to. They are THE comapany all other companies try to aspire to when it comes to sound production. When studios are mixing the audio tracks for movies and theatrical music, they use B&W. Just a thought. It never hurts to know what is out there, especially to get a frame of reference."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Pair of UE 2","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",3,"I was expecting qute a lot from it with the hefty price paid. I bought  a pair of UE Boom 2 expecting great stereo and improved sound quality while pairing two speakers.  Positives- seamless pairmant, loud, real - working stereo with right and left channel configuration option, unique for BL speakers. Individual speaker really delivers 360 degress sound, no directional bias. The quality of manufacturing is very good, we will se how it stands within next months. It looks like the speakers are up to the weather so it is a good choice for outdoor usage.Cons- the quality of sound is average, no real bass, overall  far from Jawbone not to mention Bose. EQ included into application can only make sound worse, not better- standard settings are the only optimal solution. Second issue- bluetooth connection is not perfect and has a tendency to struggle in most unexpected moments. It does not happen very often but frequently enough to notice. Not sure if I would buy again knowing all the details, Pricey."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Best purchase of the year","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Absolutely fantastic - huge sound, very portable, water-resistant for listening in the shower, and very good range. I was on the edge when this was $200, but then it dropped to 150 and I snapped it up. Absolutely worth it."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great sound for the money.","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"It is fantastic the sound is great and I now have 2 that I can Bluetooth music through my phone at the same time. If I position my phone in the right place I can have music right through the house. He price was considerably better than the first one I bought at JB Hifi. Very Happy"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","I got this over the Bose alternative, and I love it.","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"I use this around my apartment primarily.  I have a basic R/L and sub setup in my LR, but it's a pain to be working around my apartment trying to listen to the main stereo.  I either couldn't hear it that well, or I'd have to turn it up and annoy the neighbors.  I wanted a good bluetooth speaker to use in those instances.  When I was considering what to get, it essentially came down to the Bose and UE Boom 2.  There seemed to be some reliability issues with the Bose and I didn't think I would notice a quality difference for the jump in price.  I'm just not an audiophile.  In addition, I liked the sleek look of the UE Boom 2, and that is what I went with.  I still good charge, but I couldn't give an estimate as I'm always turning it on and off for widely varying periods across the course of a week."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Save your money to buy this, it's worth it.","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"Had 2 Miccus speakers die on me, should've bought this one. I really didn't think that the sound would be that much better but I was really wrong with that logic. I run this speaker at parties, my golf cart, by the hot tub, in a crowd at a BBQ cook-off, etc. I hate to admit, it's easier to hook this speaker up to my cell and run Pandora than it is to turn on the stereo, ... and it's great poolside."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","So many problems.","Style: Yeti Edition",1,"Worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon, and furthermore any website. The speaker, app, and computer app have so many issues.1. App does not recognize connected UE Boom.2. Mac update assistant does not recognize the boom.3. Boom has random volume shifts for no apparent reason. It will be on 70% and will be not loud, out of no where spike to 100%4. Boom randomly stops playing the music, which I then have to turn off and on.Overall, this product is not advisable to buy. The only thing that works about the speaker is the fact that it can simply connect to your phone. If you buy this, dont expect any of the features advertised, only the feature to play music. Too many problems, bad product."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","This is probably his favorite of all","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas.  This is probably his favorite of all. He absolutely loves it. The sound has good clarity and can get really loud. It's portable where he can take it anywhere with him. I would highly recommend the Boom for anyone who would love to be able to listen to their favorite music anywhere!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great speaker!!!","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Phenomenal sound with plenty of volume!  I had originally planned on ordering another so that I could have one at each end of the pool playing in stereo through the app, but honestly, I don't think we need another one.  Guess they built the boom too well!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","This made my days more enjoyable!","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"My boss purchased one and I was hooked. When mine arrived we realized we could sync the two. Really nice!!! Great by itself though. Very good frequency range. Plenty of bass. Makes my iPad use more enjoyable. BUT...the only bad thing is there is a minor latency issue. This only matters when watching videos. So the sound arrives milliseconds late. Other than that this was the best purchase I've made in a long time! Friends always ask about it and want one."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great small speaker, but potential quality issues.","Style: Green Machine Edition",4,"I bought two of these for work to replace our dead Jambox. One of them was dead out of the box. We could pair, but no sound. Turned on the other one and it was perfect.Overall the sound quality is great. I use them for a large, open office. It's loud enough for my team in the immediate vicinity to clearly have music - without interrupting folks around us.Would rate 5 stars if I didn't have to deal with the warranty hassle of the first speaker."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","UE BOOM 2, good to bluetooth speaker.","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"This product is great for me, as I use it in an opened area sometimes and the music gets out. It has good up time as described. A good feature it has is in the app to download to get updates and to see the battery level also the eq control. And the bass is awesome. This is a good buy."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Worth the money.","Style: Yeti Edition",5,"Makes all my other blue tooth speakers hang their heads in shame.  I have the BIG bohm and you can't hear it when this is turned up next to it and its a 1/3 of the size.  So far very happy with this purchase."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Awsome SOUND","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"This has the most incredible sound even outside when working in the yard. It worked so well I bought a second one because I found out they can link to each other from 1 sound source. Easy to connect via the simple FREE App. The sound is so great I feel it's worth every penny."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Not worth it","Style: Phantom Edition",1,"Good sound from such a little speaker, but it blew up after 10 minutes of playing it with the volume all the way up, so this is a unit where the speakers cannot handle the amplifier's output - useless"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Works Great","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"This is for the ue boom2. WoW best Bluetooth speaker I've ever had. Works fine with my Samsung phone and even my smart tv,my 2 different amazon tablets work fine. So far only been using it for a few days and no complaints"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Would definitely recommend to others","Style: Green Machine Edition",5,"This is one of the best things I've ever bought off Amazon.  I use it all the time, it's easy to set up, it's loud, and it's waterproof.  What more could you ask for!  I use it in the shower all the time because my old speakers were hard to hear over the shower and fan, but if you can bring the speakers into the shower then there's less noise to deal with.It's also great to bring to outdoor events because if it starts to spontaneously rain then you're not screwed."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","The speaker is great. The sound is quality and it carries well","Style: Phantom Edition",4,"The speaker is great. The sound is quality and it carries well, even at moderate volumes. It feels sturdy and well built. Battery lasts longer than I would have thought and open, line-of-sight distance for the bluetooth connection seems pretty good. My only issue it with Logitech support. Since upgrading to Android 6.0, and now 6.0.1, I am unable to turn the speaker on from the UE Boom app as I had been able to before on Android 5.1.1. Going through Logitech e-mail support has taken weeks and I still have no solution to the issue. They goes days and days without responding and I have been asked for information I have already provided. Other than the customer service, it is a great speaker."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Top Quality Speaker","Style: Yeti Edition",5,"I went into this purchase expecting a high quality speaker. This speaker definitely exceeded expectations. My favorite feature is the sound quality and bass reproduction. The water proof speaker definitely gives you piece of mind, and I put it in the shower with me with no problems! If you're on the fence definitely take the leap."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Loud and Clear","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Awesome. Very clear even at high volumes, and this thing gets pretty loud. Love the finish of the speaker, feels very sturdy and tough, certainly not worried about breaking it. Battery life is as reported and pairing and set up are a breeze."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great speaker, very good sound quality","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Purchased for my son's birthday.  Great speaker,  very good sound quality,  very well built, and it BOOM'S!  Very loud for a portable bluetooth speaker. Against my wishes, my son submerged it in water to test it's waterproof capabilities. Yes it passed.  Highly recommend this speaker"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Apple-like in elegance, simplicity and quality","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"I doubt you'll find a better truly portable Bluetooth speaker.  These babies put out a lot of great sound considering the small (but elegant) package.  My son says it transformed party life at his small college.  He can slide it into his back pocket and ride his bike with it blasting.  Wherever he goes, instant dance party.  He controls who can connect to the ""boomstick"".Battery life is terrific, build quality is great, and the device is almost Apple-like in elegance and simplicity.  Truly a five star product.  Pricey, but worth it."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","it is very loud and sound quality is great. I have had it for 4 months now ...","Style: Phantom Edition",3,"For how big it is, it is very loud and sound quality is great. I have had it for 4 months now and the battery only lasts about an hour. I am very disappointed after spending $190 and of coarse the warranty is over"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Boom 2 - Worth every dollar","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"I have had my Boom 2 for only a few weeks but as of right now I'm more than pleased. The sound is great, the device aesthetically pleasing, and the app to operate it is easy to use.  The battery life lasts as long as advertised.  I haven't tested its waterproof-ness, and I'm hoping I never do.  But its nice to know that should it fall into water, it will be good.  And the Bluetooth range is also as advertised.  In my opinion it was completely worth the higher price tag for the better quality product."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","and although there are some great models out there","Style: Phantom Edition",4,"I have owned a variety of portable Bluetooth speakers, and although there are some great models out there, this has been one of my favorites. The size and weight make it great for taking anywhere; and the battery life for the sound quality is pretty decent. (But like all tech guys I would always like more battery life!) (If battery life is important, and sound quality, I would recommend the Fugoo 2; which battery lasts twice as long!) Overall the speaker is great! I would have given it five stars, however, occasionally it will just disconnect from my phone, and while listening at full blast the battery dies fairly quickly. As a result of the disconnecting I have to turn on and off the speaker, or sometimes even resync the speaker to the phone to get it to stay connected. Although, this could simply be an issue with my phone, but it does not seem to do this with any other Bluetooth device."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great Speaker","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"Would give it 4.5 stars but I can't.  Many positives, only one negative.  I'll outline.Have used Jawbone and other portable speakers.  Here is my unbiased comparison.1) Battery life is solid.  I can use it for days without wearing out the battery.2) Great Volume for it's size.3) Fits in a cupholder perfectly compared to the square/rectangle speakers4) No connection issues with bluetooth.5) Has great range away from phone.6) WaterproofThe ONLY ""wish"" item:I wish it had a pause/play button in addition to the tap controls.Love the device.  My favorite thus far of the jawbone and other portable speakers I have owned."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great speaker but POTENTIAL iOS App Glitch","Style: Tropical Edition",4,"I bought this in March elsewhere but wanted to share my experience.I love the size, shape, convenience and sound. The portability is another plus and getting it wet is great for outdoors. Everything was great and then it happend. I got their app from Apple's store and I noticed the battery level was showing 80% capacity even though it was fully charged. So, I wrote Logitech Tech Support and was instructed ( advised) to do a "" factory "" reset. Since then I cannot connect to more than one device ( including previously connected) even if the device had never been connected.Prior to the first factory reset .I recommend this highly. Just a warning in case you experience. In hindsight I regret going through this process when the speaker / battery was working great!Tech support is trying to correct or determine if it's a hardware / software problem with the speaker.Otherwise 5 Stars !!!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Amazing sound. Buy it.","Style: Yeti Edition",5,"Off the top... Buy it. I'm a audiophile and I must say the sound for this thing is amazing. I promise you won't be disapointed with the sound and money spent on it. I would say it would be useful for yourself, a group of friends/family hanging out having some beers, the beach, lake, pool, park. Not for a huge party."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great product overall","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Very happy with this product. Definitely a good portable bluetooth speaker. It's loud, and quite good. Battery lasts quite long as I keep it in my bag for a couple days and it still has charge.Turning it on automatically connects to a bluetooth device, so that is very convenient."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Don't Update!","Style: Phantom Edition",2,"Beware of this speaker!  I may change my mind after I return my new UE Boom 2 to Logitech and get my replacement speaker.When I first bought this beautiful speaker, I fell in love with it. It was amazing. It was so easy to use with my IOS and android devices.  CNET was so right to say that it was an awesome speaker.Then I updated it. This has been a known problem after updating.  The speaker would no longer work anymore. I could control the volume from my iOS device but there was no sound at all.I called Logitech and after troubleshooting this speaker, he said to send it back to them for a replacement.  They provide free UPS return shipping.I will update this review again after a get my replacement speaker."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","This product is a great investment for a music lover","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"I previously purchased a the Beats pill Bluetooth speaker. It was poorly designed producing mediocre sound.  I use the UE boom 2  as my go to travel speaker.  The mid range and bass are exceptional for a speaker of this size.  This product is a great investment for a music lover ,or a person such as me,who creates podcasts and voiceovers who  needs a solid travel speaker for work."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Best sound, great battery, loud...","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"As soon as I unboxed this speaker, I decided to start playing some music. It had amazing sound, and really fills the room. It gets very loud, enough that I can use it while working out at the outside gym, and can still hear the music easily. Even after a week of workouts (about 10 hours) and some play time in the office, it still had some juice left. The app seemed to hiccup once in a blue moon, but was otherwise reliable."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Awesome speakers. Great buy.","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"We bought these speakers on a whim and fell in love with them, they have an amazing sound and not overly bassy like Beats products in my opinion.I love that they're portable shockproof and water resistant. The battery life is awesome lasted through a whole party being moved around and played non stop.I don't necessarily use the device free control where you can tap the speaker to play, pause or skip song, but it works and is nice to have.Bluetooth connectivity is strong but when connecting two UE BOOM 2s sometimes it takes a few attempts but the app makes this process easier. Also I enjoy have an option for an auxiliary cord if Bluetooth isn't available.The packaging is really nice could be used as a carrying case on more rugged or long adventures although it may be too bulky for that.Included is a charger that feels well made and not flimsy or cheap, with a good cord length."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","and the range and battery life are fantastic. Highly recommend this speaker","Style: Yeti Edition",5,"I researched many bluetooth speakers before choosing one. Chose this for the waterproofing and sound quality, and it exceeds expectations. Bass is surprisingly clear, speaker gets plenty loud, and the range and battery life are fantastic. Highly recommend this speaker! I can't wait to get a second for the pairing feature."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","the quality of the speaker is really nice, honestly","Style: Phantom Edition",4,"I picked this up as a Father's Day present for my dad. The shipping was fast, the quality of the speaker is really nice, honestly. It took a little while for him to get used to it as the interface isn't super obvious at the beginning, as the buttons aren't clearly labeled. But after a brief internet search, he found out they have an app to support the speaker, giving a more thorough set of instructions and features, as well as some settings to tinker with the equalizer. The primary complaint with it is that the bass could certainly be stronger, but the sound on acoustics and vocals is pretty fantastic. Overall, he's quite happy with the product, so I am as well. It was packaged nicely in a nice carrying case.He's also looking forward to possibly ordering a second one to enable the stereo feature down the road."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Best Speaker I've Ordered","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"I've ordered a few speakers (waterproof and not) and this is by far my favorite so far.  Powerful sound, easy to connect, and great sound.  We will be brining this to the beach regularly.  My only complaint is that there is no manual included in the box (or at least not in mine), so figuring out some of the advanced functions (battery life, skipping tracks, etc) is not super intuitive.  A small search on the internet fixed that, though, and the product is fantastic - so 5 stars!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","UE BOOM 2 vs Competition","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"At first i was reluctant because of the huge competition,JBL, Fugoo, Bose, Harmon, Philips etc., i started going to malls and listing to everything i could put my hands on but it was just too much choices: loudness vs quality, portability vs sound, lows vs mids vs highs, expensive vs cheap claiming to be great,  you name it. So i narrowed my search within the same price range / features and after lots of testing i ended up comparing Fugoo and UE BOOM 2, Fugoo is available in the local market so i could test how it sounds in person and believe me its a nice product the only issue i had with it is the weird shape and the not so clear lows, total loudness is great but place a flip 2 (not flip 3) next to it and it will demolish it (loudness and not quality). since UE Boom 2 is not available locally i had to depend on the reviews and believe me i read and saw lots mixed ones, a point that my wife looked at me one day and told me you did research on this thing more than you did on our honeymoon trip. Both are heavy on weather / shock proofing IPX7 and voice call feature, the deciding factor at the end was the looks (UE BOOM 2 brain-freeze edition won hands down) and battery life (Fugoo has the longest duration of them all claiming 40 hours its nice yes but a car charger / power bank and all the USBs and electrical sockets in the world can help solving this). despite me never knowing how it really sounds (you-tube is never accurate) eventually i chose to take the plunge on the UE BOOM 2 depending only on the reviews (its weird how humans have this infinite lust for mystery). Amazon did great with the delivery as usual and voila packaging check, looks check, built quality check, application installed and speaker updated check, its the moment of truth the speaker has only sole job to do and yessss it performs in the sound department, just what i wanted and visualized: lows, mids,  highs,  hip hop, house,  techno, classic you name it,  this tiny thing is awesome and with this price drop i would highly recommend it."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Easy to set up","Style: Green Machine Edition",5,"Easy to set up, runs for many hours on a charge. Fast portable easy way to share your phone/laptop music with your friends. I almost minus'd one star because it lacks a bit of low end, but given its tiny size it's amazing what it does put out. No regrets.  Throw it in your backpack waterbottle holder and make people remember why earbuds were invented."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","No APP for Windows Devices","Style: Phantom Edition",3,"There is no APP for windows devices for this product. If you have a windows phone be aware that you will not have access to the application nor is any development planned. Pretty lame. This will be my last Logitech purchase...there are just too many alternatives for everything they produce."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Holy crap","Style: Yeti Edition",5,"This is the speaker to get. It blows away other brands. It sounds wonderful. It's battery life and range are great. No, the bass won't shatter windows, but it's small, so you have to expect that. I have submerged mine in water to see if it would still work, and it does! If you're in the market this is the speaker to buy."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great as a speakerphone as well as a music player","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"I have been in need of a replacement speakerphone for my jambox which has gone end of support and quite frankly has not been a great business class speakerphone.  I splurged on the boom 2 and love it.  Loud enough speaker and sensitive enough mic for use in my office as well as a large conference room"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Nice sound, but I have constant problems with the ...","Style: Phantom Edition",2,"Nice sound, but I have constant problems with the wireless connection between the speaker and my smart phone. When I use iHeart Radio, the speaker loses the connection after each song ends. It's a pain having to re-connect for each song. This has left me very frustrated and I would return the product, but I have too much going on right now..."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great speaker to bring to the beach or camping","Style: Yeti Edition",4,"Great speaker to bring to the beach or camping.  Reasonably loud for its size. Great battery life compared to many options out there, but if you use maximum volume you will not get nearly as much as advertised.  Using it at less than maximum i have used it for over 7hrs without charging, but it died around the 6 hr mark for me when on full blast the entire time.  You can double up with the original Boom, but it won't output in stereo, (one speaker acting as left, and one as right), with that model.  Bluetooth sync is easy, and all the controls are easy to use and learn."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Love it- sounds great!","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Love this speaker!  The sound carries really well and it's very simple to use. I use it to teach yoga classes and carry it around to various places. It has held up very well and doesn't show scratches. Great product if you need a speaker that will hold up to being bumped around. I used a Bose sound link before this and I prefer the UE Boom!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Not your grandma's boombox........","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"Purchased this for my 12 year old granddaughter's birthday. It sounds awesome. She takes it everywhere. Now her Dad wants the larger one. He previously purchased a Bose system and the UE Boom 2 beats it by a mile. She can drowned him out. If he's good, maybe Santa will bring him one for Christmas....."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Buy this one!","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"Great sound quality, excellent bass for a small unit.  Amazing volume - and no distortion even when playing it loud!  Battery lasts FOREVER on a charge.  We've used it off and on on nice days this Spring and it's been over 2 weeks without recharging so far!  Stop looking at other portable bluetooth speakers and buy this one!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great Sound from a great speaker!","Style: Cherrybomb Edition",5,"This speaker is awesome.  Great sound and easy to use.  Waterproof is great as it makes it easy to take to parties, picnics, etc.  You can't beat this speaker.Volume buttons are huge and super easy to operate.  It has good connectivity range with my bluetooth devices so you can move around with your phone without it cutting out.Good base from this little speaker.Charge lasts for hours, so you can listen to music until your heart is content.Tap the top of the speaker to skip songs which is a convenient feature....as long as your annoying friends don't figure out how to use it and start skipping good songs on you!"
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Best musical purchase I've ever made","Style: Phantom Edition",5,"Absolutely the best music purchase I've ever made!! My son was given one as a graduation gift from high school and took it with him to college, so we missed it at the house. I bought one because I missed it so much!! I can hear it when I do yard work and all through the house during other chores. My son would use it during his showers which would last way too long!! The quality is great and the battery life is incredible too. On a medium volume, which is still relatively loud, it lasts easily up to 8 hours."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","WORST SUPPORT EVER! DON'T BUY IT!","Style: Green Machine Edition",1,"WORST SUPPORT EVER! DON'T BUY IT!Bought the BOOM 2 last month and never worked so well . I had trouble connecting the device the first time with my iPhone 6 and my MacBook Pro Retina ( Yosemite ) . After I downloaded the App EU got worse.The device controls didn't respond, I could control only by my iPhone. No device button seemed to work at all. So I went in Bluetooth option from my cell phone and clicked on "" forget this device "", and RESET the BOOM 2 by pressing the volume button - and the power button simultaneously for 10 seconds and after that the device never turn on again . I wrote about 4 emails to UE Logitech Support on their webpage, but never got any response . UE Logitech is not interested in support for anyone. It is NOT a serious company . I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. I want my money back."
"UE-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof","Great sound, easy to use, what's not to love?!","Style: BrainFreeze Edition",5,"This is one of my best recent purchases! Bought it to take on trips and took it to Brazil for carnaval on the beach in southern Bahia. The sound works great out in the open, even on a windy beach, and I didn't have to worry about ocean spray and sand. Now back home I have it in my shower so I can listen to some tunes while cleaning up.It is a bit pricey, but for the quality delivered I thing it's totally worth it.Highly recommended!!"
